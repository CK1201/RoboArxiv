To this end, we propose Code-as-Monitor (CaM), a\nnovel paradigm leveraging the vision-language model (VLM) for both open-set\nreactive and proactive failure detection. The core of our method is to\nformulate both tasks as a unified set of spatio-temporal constraint\nsatisfaction problems and use VLM-generated code to evaluate them for real-time\nmonitoring. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring, we further\nintroduce constraint elements that abstract constraint-related entities or\ntheir parts into compact geometric elements. This approach offers greater\ngenerality, simplifies tracking, and facilitates constraint-aware visual\nprogramming by leveraging these elements as visual prompts. Experiments show\nthat CaM achieves a 28.7% higher success rate and reduces execution time by\n31.8% under severe disturbances compared to baselines across three simulators\nand a real-world setting.

However, these systems face challenges\nin dynamic, severe occlusion scenes (e.g., crowds) due to limitations in\nperception networks' low prediction accuracy and path planners' high\ncomputation overhead. In this paper, we propose OMEGA, which contains OccMamba\nwith an Efficient AGR-Planner to address the above-mentioned problems. OccMamba\nadopts a novel architecture that separates semantic and occupancy prediction\ninto independent branches, incorporating two mamba blocks within these\nbranches. These blocks efficiently extract semantic and geometric features in\n3D environments with linear complexity, ensuring that the network can learn\nlong-distance dependencies to improve prediction accuracy. Semantic and\ngeometric features are combined within the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space to\nminimise computational overhead during feature fusion.

The proposed framework leverages multi-lane\nmacroscopic traffic models that describe spatial-temporal dynamics of the\ndensity and speed for each lane. Lateral traffic flow between adjacent lanes,\nresulting from aggregated lane-changing behaviors, is modeled as source terms\nexchanged between the partial differential equations (PDEs).

However, the\nsafety aspect of RL and the transfer to the real world remain an open\nchallenge. A prominent field for tackling this challenge and ensuring the\nsafety of the agents during training and execution is safe reinforcement\nlearning. Safe RL can be achieved through constrained RL and safe exploration\napproaches. The former learns the safety constraints over the course of\ntraining to achieve a safe behavior by the end of training, at the cost of high\nnumber of collisions at earlier stages of the training. The latter offers\nrobust safety by enforcing the safety constraints as hard constraints, which\nprevents collisions but hinders the exploration of the RL agent, resulting in\nlower rewards and poor performance. To overcome those drawbacks, we propose a\nnovel safety shield, that combines the robustness of the optimization-based\ncontrollers with the long prediction capabilities of the RL agents, allowing\nthe RL agent to adaptively tune the parameters of the controller.

We developed a piezoresistive pressure\nsensor and used a microphone to mimic touch and sound channels, respectively.\nIn a study with 28 participants, each conveyed 10 emotions to a robot using\nspontaneous touch gestures. Our findings reveal a statistically significant\nconsistency in emotion expression among participants. However, some emotions\nobtained low intraclass correlation values.

We subsequently constructed a multi-modal\nintegrating touch and audio features to decode the 10 emotions. A support\nvector machine (SVM) model demonstrated the highest accuracy, achieving 40% for\n10 classes, with \"Attention\" being the most accurately conveyed emotion at a\nbalanced accuracy of 87.65%.\n","authors":["Qiaoqiao Ren","Remko Proesmans","Frederick Bossuyt","Jan Vanfleteren","Francis Wyffels","Tony Belpaeme"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03300v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03293v1","updated":"2024-12-04T13:11:38Z","published":"2024-12-04T13:11:38Z","title":"Diffusion-VLA: Scaling Robot Foundation Models via Unified Diffusion and\n  Autoregression","summary":"  In this paper, we present DiffusionVLA, a novel framework that seamlessly\ncombines the autoregression model with the diffusion model for learning\nvisuomotor policy.

Different from conventional whole-body\nloco-manipulation problems that track both floating-base and end-effector\ncommands, the direct EE pose tracking problem requires inherent balance among\nredundant degrees of freedom in the whole-body motion. We leverage RL to solve\nthis challenging problem.

To test the interaction between the CPS software and the\nsystem's physics, engineers provide traces of desired physical states and\nobserve traces of the actual physical states. CPS requirements describe how\nclosely the actual physical traces should track the desired traces. These\nrequirements are typically defined for specific, simple input traces such as\nstep or ramp sequences, and thus are not applicable to arbitrary inputs. This\nlimits the availability of oracles for CPSs. Our recent work proposes an\napproach to testing CPS using control-theoretical design assumptions instead of\nrequirements. This approach circumvents the oracle problem by leveraging the\ncontrol-theoretical guarantees that are provided when the design assumptions\nare satisfied. To address the test case generation and oracle problems,\nresearchers have proposed metamorphic testing, which is based on the study of\nrelations across tests, i.e., metamorphic relations (MRs). In this work, we\ndefine MRs based on the design assumptions and explore combinations of these\nMRs using genetic programming to generate CPS test cases. This enables the\ngeneration of CPS input traces with potentially arbitrary shapes, together with\nassociated expected output traces. We use the deviation from the expected\noutput traces to guide the generation of input traces that falsify the MRs. Our\nexperiment results show that the MR-falsification provides engineers with new\ninformation, helping them identify passed and failed test cases. Furthermore,\nwe show that the generation of traces that falsify the MRs is a non-trivial\nproblem, which is successfully addressed by our genetic search.\n","authors":["Claudio Mandrioli","Seung Yeob Shin","Domenico Bianculli","Lionel Briand"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03330v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17882v2","updated":"2024-12-04T13:14:15Z","published":"2024-10-23T13:55:42Z","title":"Identifiable Representation and Model Learning for Latent Dynamic\n  Systems","summary":"  Learning identifiable representations and models from low-level observations\nis helpful for an intelligent spacecraft to complete downstream tasks reliably.\nFor temporal observations, to ensure that the data generating process is\nprovably inverted, most existing works either assume the noise variables in the\ndynamic mechanisms are (conditionally) independent or require that the\ninterventions can directly affect each latent variable.

Robust Control Barrier Functions (RCBFs) offer\na potential solution, but the non-smoothness of the standard RCBF definition\ncan pose a challenge when dealing with multiple derivatives in high relative\ndegree problems. As a result, the definition was extended to the marginally\nmore conservative smooth Robust Control Barrier Functions (sRCBF). Then, by\nextending the sRCBF framework to the CBF backstepping method, this paper offers\na novel approach to these problems. Treating obstacle dynamics as disturbances,\nour approach reduces the requirement for precise state estimations of the\nobstacle to an upper bound on the disturbance, which simplifies implementation\nand enhances the robustness and applicability of CBFs in dynamic and uncertain\nenvironments. Then, we validate our technique through an example problem in\nwhich an agent, modeled using a kinematic unicycle model, aims to avoid an\nunknown moving obstacle. The demonstration shows that the standard CBF\nbackstepping method is not sufficient in the presence of a moving obstacle,\nespecially with unknown dynamics.

To address these challenges, this work\nintroduces an adaptive LiDAR odometry and mapping framework tailored for\nautonomous agricultural mobile robots operating in complex agricultural\nenvironments. The proposed framework consists of a robust LiDAR odometry\nalgorithm based on dense Generalized-ICP scan matching, and an adaptive mapping\nmodule that considers motion stability and point cloud consistency for\nselective map updates. The key design principle of this framework is to\nprioritize the incremental consistency of the map by rejecting motion-distorted\npoints and sparse dynamic objects, which in turn leads to high accuracy in\nodometry estimated from scan matching against the map.

Whereas the forelimbs evolved into wings primarily for flight,\nthe hindlimbs serve diverse functions such as walking, hopping, and leaping,\nand jumping take-off for transitions into flight. These capabilities have\ninspired engineers to aim for similar multi-modality in aerial robots,\nexpanding their range of applications across diverse environments. However,\nchallenges remain in reproducing multi-modal locomotion, across gaits with\ndistinct kinematics and propulsive characteristics, such as walking and\njumping, while preserving lightweight mass for flight. This tradeoff between\nmechanical complexity and versatility limits most existing aerial robots to\nonly one additional locomotor mode. Here, we overcome the\ncomplexity-versatility tradeoff with RAVEN (Robotic Avian-inspired Vehicle for\nmultiple ENvironments), which uses its bird-inspired multi-functional legs to\njump rapidly into flight, walk on ground and hop over obstacles and gaps\nsimilar to the multi-modal locomotion of birds. We show that jumping for\ntake-off contributes substantially to initial flight take-off speed and,\nremarkably, that it is more energy-efficient than solely propeller-based\ntake-off. Our analysis suggests an important tradeoff in mass distribution\nbetween legs and body among birds adapted for different locomotor strategies,\nwith greater investment in leg mass among terrestrial birds with multi-modal\ngait demands. Multi-functional robot legs expand opportunities to deploy\ntraditional fixed-wing aircraft in complex terrains through autonomous\ntake-offs and multi-modal gaits.\n","authors":["Won Dong Shin","Hoang-Vu Phan","Monica A.

Although existing methods have\nconducted in-depth research on slip detection and grasping force planning, they\noften overlook the issue of adaptive tracking of the actual force to the target\nforce when handling objects with different material properties. The optimal\nparameters of a force tracking controller are significantly influenced by the\nobject's stiffness, and many adaptive force tracking algorithms rely on\nstiffness estimation. However, real-world objects often exhibit viscous,\nplastic, or other more complex nonlinear time-varying behaviors, and existing\nstudies provide insufficient support for these materials in terms of stiffness\ndefinition and estimation. To address this, this paper introduces the concept\nof generalized stiffness, extending the definition of stiffness to nonlinear\ntime-varying grasp system models, and proposes an online generalized stiffness\nestimator based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Based on generalized\nstiffness, this paper proposes an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy using\na PI controller as an example, enabling dynamic force tracking for objects with\nvarying characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod achieves high precision and short probing time, while showing better\nadaptability to non-ideal objects compared to existing methods.

Preliminary simulation results\nindicate that using AI in the provision of resources related to costs can\nreduce expenditure by up to 30-40% compared to manual provisioning and\nthreshold-based auto-scaling approaches. It is also estimated that the\nefficiency in resource utilization is expected to improve by 20%-30% with a\ncorresponding latency cut of 15%-20% during the peak demand periods. This study\ncompares the AI-driven approach with existing static and rule-based resource\nallocation methods, demonstrating the capability of this new model to\noutperform them in terms of flexibility and real-time interests. The results\nindicate that reinforcement learning can make optimization of hybrid cloud\nplatforms even better, offering a 25-35% improvement in cost efficiency and the\npower of scaling for microservice-based applications.

Here, restricted problems are\ncreated by removing significant numbers of variables. The restricted problem is\nsolved, and the unused variables are priced to test which, if any, could\nimprove the objective of the restricted problem if they were to be added.\nColumn generation methods are problem-specific, and so there is no guaranteed\nsolution to these categorical problems. As such, the following paper proposes\nguidelines for defining restricted problems representing space exploration\nmission concepts of operations.

To mitigate such attacks, the defender\nintroduces asymmetrical information by deploying a \"hidden sensor,\" whose\npresence is initially undisclosed but can be revealed if queried. We introduce\nhypergames on graphs to model this game with asymmetric information.

As a second contribution, we propose an optimization-based\npose and shape corrector that can correct estimation errors caused by a domain\ngap. Observing that the shape decoder is well behaved in the convex hull of\nknown shapes, we approximate the shape decoder with an active shape model, and\nshow that this reduces the shape correction problem to a constrained linear\nleast squares problem, which can be solved efficiently by an interior point\nalgorithm.

Solutions to SLAM and MOT usually rely on\ncertain assumptions, such as the static environment assumption for SLAM and the\naccurate ego-vehicle pose assumption for MOT. But in complex dynamic\nenvironments, it is difficult or even impossible to meet these assumptions.\nTherefore, the SLAMMOT, i.e., simultaneous localization, mapping, and moving\nobject tracking, integrated system of SLAM and object tracking, has emerged for\nautonomous vehicles in dynamic environments.

In this article,\nwe introduce a class of deception techniques and study how to leverage\nasymmetric information created by deception to strengthen CPS security.\nConsider an adversarial interaction between a CPS defender and an attacker, who\ncan perform sensor jamming attacks. To mitigate such attacks, the defender\nintroduces asymmetrical information by deploying a \"hidden sensor,\" whose\npresence is initially undisclosed but can be revealed if queried. We introduce\nhypergames on graphs to model this game with asymmetric information. Building\non the solution concept called subjective rationalizable strategies in\nhypergames, we identify two stages in the game: An initial game stage where the\ndefender commits to a strategy perceived rationalizable by the attacker until\nhe deviates from the equilibrium in the attacker's perceptual game; Upon the\ndeviation, a delay-attack game stage starts where the defender plays against\nthe attacker, who has a bounded delay in attacking the sensor being revealed.\nBased on backward induction, we develop an algorithm that determines, for any\ngiven state, if the defender can benefit from hiding a sensor and revealing it\nlater. If the answer is affirmative, the algorithm outputs a sensor revealing\nstrategy to determine when to reveal the sensor during dynamic interactions.

In this work, we propose an\noperational framework that integrates route guidance and collision avoidance to\nachieve an elegant trade-off between air traffic safety and efficiency. The\nroute guidance mechanism aims to optimize aircraft distribution across both\nspatial and temporal dimensions by regulating their paths (composed of\nwaypoints).

Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) was introduced\nto accelerate the scenario-based test of ADSs by utilizing the historical test\ninformation to generate new test cases. However, a single optimum found by the\nBBO algorithm is insufficient for the purpose of a comprehensive safety\nevaluation of ADSs in a logical scenario. In fact, all the subspaces\nrepresenting danger in the logical scenario space, rather than only the most\ncritical concrete scenario, play a more significant role for the safety\nevaluation. Covering as many of the critical concrete scenarios in a logical\nscenario space through a limited number of tests is defined as the Black-Box\nCoverage (BBC) problem in this paper. We formalized this problem in a\nsample-based search paradigm and constructed a coverage criterion with\nConfusion Matrix Analysis. Furthermore, we propose LAMBDA (Latent-Action\nMonte-Carlo Beam Search with Density Adaption) to solve BBC problems. LAMBDA\ncan quickly focus on critical subspaces by recursively partitioning the logical\nscenario space into accepted and rejected parts.

Modularization decompose the driving task into\nmodules such as perception, prediction, planning, and control, and train them\nseparately. Due to the inconsistency of training objectives between modules,\nthe integrated effect suffers from bias. End-to-end attempts to address this\nissue by utilizing a single model that directly maps from sensor data to\ncontrol signals. This path has limited learning capabilities in a comprehensive\nset of features and struggles to handle unpredictable long-tail events and\ncomplex urban traffic scenarios. In the face of challenges encountered in both\npaths, many researchers believe that large language models (LLMs) with powerful\nreasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge understanding may be the\nsolution, expecting LLMs to provide AD systems with deeper levels of\nunderstanding and decision-making capabilities. In light of the challenges\nfaced by both paths, many researchers believe that LLMs, with their powerful\nreasoning abilities and extensive knowledge, could offer a solution. To\nunderstand if LLMs could enhance AD, this paper conducts a thorough analysis of\nthe potential applications of LLMs in AD systems, including exploring their\noptimization strategies in both modular and end-to-end approaches, with a\nparticular focus on how LLMs can tackle the problems and challenges present in\ncurrent solutions.

Most RH studies used nominal\nscenarios with regular demand patterns. However, disruptions must be considered\ndue to their negative impact on operational efficiency, such as longer travel\ntimes, higher costs, increased transfers, and more service delays. Therefore,\nthis study investigates the resilience of RH fleet management strategies in\nmulti-modal transportation systems against disruptions on train lines. Two\nfleet management strategies, centralized and decentralized, are introduced to\nevaluate their performance. A traffic simulation is conducted using a 900 km2\ntoy urban network that includes multiple transportation modes such as trains,\nmetros, buses, and RHs. The results revealed that during the peak of\ndisruption, the centralized strategy maintained a higher level of service but\nrequired a longer recovery time. In contrast, the decentralized strategy showed\na lower service level but recovered more quickly. The centralized strategy\nshowed higher performance during regular scenarios, while the decentralized\nstrategy showed better resilience during disruptions. Comparing the two\nstrategies provides critical insights for developing intermediate RH strategies\nto effectively manage disruptions and enhance the seamlessness of multi-modal\ntransportation systems.\n","authors":["Euntak Lee","Rim Slama Salmi","Ludovic Leclercq"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00276v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00211v1","updated":"2024-11-29T19:19:21Z","published":"2024-11-29T19:19:21Z","title":"Dissipative iFIR filters for data-driven design","summary":"  We tackle the problem of providing closed-loop stability guarantees with a\nscalable data-driven design.

This\nselected strategy additionally needs to yield an equilibrium intra-personally,\nso as to resolve time inconsistency among the investor's current and future\nselves (triggered by the mean-variance objective).

This article introduces a fast real-time trajectory\ngeneration approach for soft robot manipulators, which creates\ndynamically-feasible motions for arbitrary kinematically-feasible paths of the\nrobot's end effector. Our insight is that piecewise constant curvature (PCC)\ndynamics models of soft robots can be differentially flat, therefore control\ninputs can be calculated algebraically rather than through a nonlinear\ndifferential equation. We prove this flatness under certain conditions, with\nthe curvatures of the robot as the flat outputs.

Compared to a single UAV\nequipped with a short-baseline stereo camera, multi-UAV collaborative vision\noffers a wide and variable baseline, providing potential benefits in flexible\nand large-scale depth perception. In this paper, we propose the concept of a\ncollaborative stereo camera, where the left and right cameras are mounted on\ntwo UAVs that share an overlapping FOV. Considering the dynamic flight of two\nUAVs in the real world, the FOV and relative pose of the left and right cameras\nare continuously changing. Compared to fixed-baseline stereo cameras, this\naerial collaborative stereo system introduces two challenges, which are highly\nreal-time requirements for dynamic cross-camera stereo feature association and\nrelative pose estimation of left and right cameras. To address these\nchallenges, we first propose a real-time dual-channel feature association\nalgorithm with a guidance-prediction structure. Then, we propose a Relative\nMulti-State Constrained Kalman Filter (Rel-MSCKF) algorithm to estimate the\nrelative pose by fusing co-visual features and UAVs' visual-inertial odometry\n(VIO). Extensive experiments are performed on the popular onboard computer\nNVIDIA NX. Results on the resource-constrained platform show that the real-time\nperformance of the dual-channel feature association is significantly superior\nto traditional methods. The convergence of Rel-MSCKF is assessed under\ndifferent initial baseline errors. In the end, we present a potential\napplication of aerial collaborative stereo for remote mapping obstacles in\nurban scenarios.

We introduce four performance\nmetrics, focusing on safety, energy consumption, passenger comfort, and\nrobustness of vehicular platoons. The safety metric is based on momentary\ndistances between neighboring vehicles, their relative velocities, and relative\naccelerations. Thus, to have access to these relative values, we formulate the\ncoupled dynamics between pairs of neighboring vehicles, considering initial\nconditions (position, velocity, acceleration), leader vehicle's\nvelocity/acceleration trajectory, deployed RCT, and vehicles' parity/disparity.\nBy decoupling the dynamics using a mapping matrix structured on deployed RCT,\nvehicles' features, and control gains, precise formulations for distance\nerrors, relative velocities, and relative accelerations between all neighboring\nvehicles, over the travel time, are obtained. Comparing performance metric\nresults across RCTs highlights that downstream information transmission-from\nvehicles ahead, particularly the leader vehicle, to vehicles\nbehind-significantly enhances platoon stability, safety, energy consumption,\nand passenger comfort metrics. Conversely, receiving state information from\nvehicles behind degrades metrics, compromising safety, increasing energy\nconsumption, and reducing passenger comfort.

Deterministic forecasting provides only point\nestimates and cannot capture potential outcomes. Therefore, probabilistic\nforecasting has gained significant attention due to its ability to quantify\nuncertainty, where one of the approaches is to express it as a prediction\ninterval (PI), that explicitly shows upper and lower bounds of predictions\nassociated with a confidence level. High-quality PI is characterized by a high\nPI coverage probability (PICP) and a narrow PI width. In many real-world\napplications, the PI width is generally used in risk management to prepare\nresources that improve reliability and effectively manage uncertainty. A wider\nPI width results in higher costs for backup resources as decision-making\nprocesses often focus on the worst-case scenarios arising with large PI widths\nunder extreme conditions. This study aims to reduce the large PI width from the\nPI estimation method by proposing a new PI loss function that penalizes the\naverage of the large PI widths more heavily. The proposed formulation is\ncompatible with gradient-based algorithms, the standard approach to training\nneural networks (NNs), and integrating state-of-the-art NNs and existing deep\nlearning techniques. Experiments with the synthetic dataset reveal that our\nformulation significantly reduces the large PI width while effectively\nmaintaining the PICP to achieve the desired probability. The practical\nimplementation of our proposed loss function is demonstrated in solar\nirradiance forecasting, highlighting its effectiveness in minimizing the large\nPI width in data with high uncertainty and showcasing its compatibility with\nmore complex neural network models. Therefore, reducing large PI widths from\nour method can lead to significant cost savings by over-allocation of reserve\nresources.\n","authors":["Worachit Amnuaypongsa","Jitkomut Songsiri"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.19181v2.pdf","comment":"28 pages, 12 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08005v1","updated":"2024-12-11T01:19:43Z","published":"2024-12-11T01:19:43Z","title":"Survey on Human-Vehicle Interactions and AI Collaboration for Optimal\n  Decision-Making in Automated Driving","summary":"  The capabilities of automated vehicles are advancing rapidly, yet achieving\nfull autonomy remains a significant challenge, requiring ongoing human\ncognition in decision-making processes.

The\ntrajectory generation exploits the state predictions of the USV to create\nperiodically updated trajectories for a multirotor UAV to precisely land on the\ndeck of a moving USV even in cases where the deck's inclination is continuously\nchanging. We use an MPC-based scheme to create trajectories that consider both\nthe UAV dynamics and the predicted states of the USV up to the first derivative\nof position and orientation. Compared to existing approaches, our method\ndynamically modifies the penalization matrices to precisely follow the\ncorresponding states with respect to the flight phase. Especially during the\nlanding maneuver, the UAV synchronizes attitude with the USV's, allowing for\nfast landing on a tilted deck. Simulations show the method's reliability in\nvarious sea conditions up to Rough sea (wave height 4 m), outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods in landing speed and accuracy, with twice the\nprecision on average.

The findings are twofold: Firstly, we prove that any boundary point of\nthe reachability set, with the terminal direction taken into account, can be\naccessed via curves of H, CSC, CCC, or their respective subsegments, where H\ndenotes a helicoidal arc, C a circular arc with maximum curvature, and S a\nstraight segment. Secondly, we show that any boundary point of the reachability\nset, without considering the terminal direction, can be accessed by curves of\nCC, CS, or their respective subsegments. These findings extend the developments\npresented in literature regarding planar curves, or Dubins car dynamics, into\nspatial curves in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. For higher dimensions, we confirm that the\nproblem of identifying the reachability set of curvature bounded paths subsumes\nthe well-known Markov-Dubins problem. These advancements in understanding the\nreachability of curvature bounded paths in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ hold significant\npractical implications, particularly in the contexts of mission planning\nproblems and time optimal guidance.\n","authors":["Juho Bae","Ji Hoon Bai","Byung-Yoon Lee","Jun-Yong Lee","Chang-Hun Lee"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18707v2.pdf","comment":"Submitted to Automatica"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07105v1","updated":"2024-12-10T01:45:14Z","published":"2024-12-10T01:45:14Z","title":"A Powered Prosthetic Hand with Vision System for Enhancing the\n  Anthropopathic Grasp","summary":"  The anthropomorphism of grasping process significantly benefits the\nexperience and grasping efficiency of prosthetic hand wearers. Currently,\nprosthetic hands controlled by signals such as brain-computer interfaces (BCI)\nand electromyography (EMG) face difficulties in precisely recognizing the\namputees' grasping gestures and executing anthropomorphic grasp processes.\nAlthough prosthetic hands equipped with vision systems enables the objects'\nfeature recognition, they lack perception of human grasping intention.\nTherefore, this paper explores the estimation of grasping gestures solely\nthrough visual data to accomplish anthropopathic grasping control and the\ndetermination of grasping intention within a multi-object environment. To\naddress this, we propose the Spatial Geometry-based Gesture Mapping (SG-GM)\nmethod, which constructs gesture functions based on the geometric features of\nthe human hand grasping processes. It's subsequently implemented on the\nprosthetic hand. Furthermore, we propose the Motion Trajectory Regression-based\nGrasping Intent Estimation (MTR-GIE) algorithm.

This challenge is particularly evident in autonomous\nvehicles and mobile robotics, where data is collected with fixed camera setups,\nlimiting the geometric diversity.

Second, considering the weak correlation between the initial error\nand motion distortion of current frame, we propose a convergence criteria based\non pointcloud constraints to control the back propagation.

Traditional\nscene representation methods generally cannot infer the geometry of unobserved\nregions of the objects from the image. Attempts have been made to leverage deep\nlearning to train on a dataset of observed objects and representations, and\nthen generalize to new observations.

Recent research has proposed\nthe use of a large language model (LLM) to generate reward functions in\nreinforcement learning, thereby replacing the need for manually designed\nrewards by experts. However, this approach, which relies on textual\ndescriptions to define learning objectives, fails to achieve controllable and\nprecise behavior learning with clear directionality. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new video2reward method, which directly generates reward functions\nfrom videos depicting the behaviors to be mimicked and learned.

Hybrid Imitation Learning via Salient Points","summary":"  While imitation learning (IL) offers a promising framework for teaching\nrobots various behaviors, learning complex tasks remains challenging. Existing\nIL policies struggle to generalize effectively across visual and spatial\nvariations even for simple tasks. In this work, we introduce SPHINX: Salient\nPoint-based Hybrid ImitatioN and eXecution, a flexible IL policy that leverages\nmultimodal observations (point clouds and wrist images), along with a hybrid\naction space of low-frequency, sparse waypoints and high-frequency, dense end\neffector movements. Given 3D point cloud observations, SPHINX learns to infer\ntask-relevant points within a point cloud, or salient points, which support\nspatial generalization by focusing on semantically meaningful features. These\nsalient points serve as anchor points to predict waypoints for long-range\nmovement, such as reaching target poses in free-space. Once near a salient\npoint, SPHINX learns to switch to predicting dense end-effector movements given\nclose-up wrist images for precise phases of a task. By exploiting the strengths\nof different input modalities and action representations for different\nmanipulation phases, SPHINX tackles complex tasks in a sample-efficient,\ngeneralizable manner. Our method achieves 86.7% success across 4 real-world and\n2 simulated tasks, outperforming the next best state-of-the-art IL baseline by\n41.1% on average across 440 real world trials.

However, achieving optimal performance requires that the\nrobot's level of assistance adjusts the operator's cognitive workload in\nresponse to the task difficulty. Understanding and dynamically adjusting this\nbalance is crucial to maximizing efficiency and user satisfaction. In this\npaper, we propose a novel benchmarking method for shared control systems based\non Fitts' Law to formally parameterize the difficulty level of a\ntarget-reaching task. With this we systematically quantify and model the effect\nof task difficulty (i.e. size and distance of target) and robot autonomy on\ntask performance and operators' cognitive load and trust levels. Our empirical\nresults (N=24) not only show that both task difficulty and robot autonomy\ninfluence task performance, but also that the performance can be modelled using\nthese parameters, which may allow for the generalization of this relationship\nacross more diverse setups.

Given the challenges in\ndirectly measuring cognitive load in real-time, our adapted Fitts' model\npresents a potential alternative approach to estimate cognitive load through\ndetermining the difficulty level of the task, with the assumption that greater\ntask difficulty results in higher cognitive load levels.

This motivates us to propose FlowPolicy, a\nnovel framework for fast policy generation based on consistency flow matching\nand 3D vision.

Existing algorithms\nfor lane-change control often depend on vehicles with a certain level of\nautonomy (e.g., autonomous or connected autonomous vehicles). To address the\nchallenges posed by low penetration rates of autonomous vehicles and the high\ncosts of precise data collection, this study proposes a dynamic lane change\nregulation design based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance\nfreeway traffic efficiency. The proposed framework leverages multi-lane\nmacroscopic traffic models that describe spatial-temporal dynamics of the\ndensity and speed for each lane. Lateral traffic flow between adjacent lanes,\nresulting from aggregated lane-changing behaviors, is modeled as source terms\nexchanged between the partial differential equations (PDEs). We propose a lane\nchange regulation strategy using MARL, where one agent is placed at each\ndiscretized lane grid. The state of each agent is represented by aggregated\nvehicle attributes within its grid, generated from the SUMO microscopic\nsimulation environment. The agent's actions are lane-change regulations for\nvehicles in its grid. Specifically, lane-change regulation signals are computed\nat a centralized traffic management center and then broadcast to connected\nvehicles in the corresponding lane grids. Compared to vehicle-level maneuver\ncontrol, this approach achieves a higher regulation rate by leveraging vehicle\nconnectivity while introducing no critical safety concerns, and accommodating\nvarying levels of connectivity and autonomy within the traffic system.

Besides, for the MFG, we show\nthat convexity and small mean field effect condition for the first part of\nrunning cost functional and the quasi-monotonicity condition for the second\npart together imply the $\\beta$-monotonicity and thus the well-posedness for\nthe associated FBSDEs. For the MFTC problem, we show that the\n$\\beta$-monotonicity for the corresponding FBSDEs is simply the convexity\nassumption on the cost functional.

                                        <span>  Understanding, navigating, and exploring the 3D physical real world has long
been a central challenge in the development of artificial intelligence. In this
work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of
planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative
imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding
environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment
from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic
video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine,
our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous
360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for
AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world
generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates
strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by
generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to
perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and
goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding
unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different
outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. In
summary, we demonstrate that GenEx provides a transformative platform for
advancing embodied AI in imaginative spaces and brings potential for extending
these capabilities to real-world exploration.

                                        <span>  This study seeks to automate camera movement control for filming existing
subjects into attractive videos, contrasting with the creation of non-existent
content by directly generating the pixels. We select drone videos as our test
case due to their rich and challenging motion patterns, distinctive viewing
angles, and precise controls. Existing AI videography methods struggle with
limited appearance diversity in simulation training, high costs of recording
expert operations, and difficulties in designing heuristic-based goals to cover
all scenarios. To avoid these issues, we propose a scalable method that
involves collecting real-world training data to improve diversity, extracting
camera trajectories automatically to minimize annotation costs, and training an
effective architecture that does not rely on heuristics. Specifically, we
collect 99k high-quality trajectories by running 3D reconstruction on online
videos, connecting camera poses from consecutive frames to formulate 3D camera
paths, and using Kalman filter to identify and remove low-quality data.
Moreover, we introduce DVGFormer, an auto-regressive transformer that leverages
the camera path and images from all past frames to predict camera movement in
the next frame. We evaluate our system across 38 synthetic natural scenes and 7
real city 3D scans. We show that our system effectively learns to perform
challenging camera movements such as navigating through obstacles, maintaining
low altitude to increase perceived speed, and orbiting towers and buildings,
which are very useful for recording high-quality videos. Data and code are
available at dvgformer.github.io.

                                        <span>  Tactile sensing is crucial for robots aiming to achieve human-level
dexterity. Among tactile-dependent skills, tactile-based object tracking serves
as the cornerstone for many tasks, including manipulation, in-hand
manipulation, and 3D reconstruction. In this work, we introduce NormalFlow, a
fast, robust, and real-time tactile-based 6DoF tracking algorithm. Leveraging
the precise surface normal estimation of vision-based tactile sensors,
NormalFlow determines object movements by minimizing discrepancies between the
tactile-derived surface normals. Our results show that NormalFlow consistently
outperforms competitive baselines and can track low-texture objects like table
surfaces. For long-horizon tracking, we demonstrate when rolling the sensor
around a bead for 360 degrees, NormalFlow maintains a rotational tracking error
of 2.5 degrees. Additionally, we present state-of-the-art tactile-based 3D
reconstruction results, showcasing the high accuracy of NormalFlow. We believe
NormalFlow unlocks new possibilities for high-precision perception and
manipulation tasks that involve interacting with objects using hands. The video

applied to the challenging new CARLA Leaderboard 2.0. Further, while there is a
large body of literature on end-to-end architectures and training strategies,
the impact of the training dataset is often overlooked. In this work, we make a
first attempt at end-to-end driving for Leaderboard 2.0. Instead of
investigating architectures, we systematically analyze the training dataset,
leading to new insights: (1) Expert style significantly affects downstream
policy performance. (2) In complex data sets, the frames should not be weighted
on the basis of simplistic criteria such as class frequencies. (3) Instead,
estimating whether a frame changes the target labels compared to previous
frames can reduce the size of the dataset without removing important
information. By incorporating these findings, our model ranks first and second
respectively on the map and sensors tracks of the 2024 CARLA Challenge, and
sets a new state-of-the-art on the Bench2Drive test routes. Finally, we uncover
a design flaw in the current evaluation metrics and propose a modification for
future challenges. Our dataset, code, and pre-trained models are publicly

shown strong predictive capabilities for scene dynamics in robotic manipulation
tasks. However, their inherent non-linearity presents significant challenges
for effective planning. Current planning methods, often dependent on extensive

GPU-accelerated branch-and-bound (BaB) framework for motion planning in

models. Our approach employs a specialized branching heuristics to divide the
search space into subdomains, and applies a modified bound propagation method,
inspired by the state-of-the-art neural network verifier alpha-beta-CROWN, to
efficiently estimate objective bounds within these subdomains. The branching
process guides planning effectively, while the bounding process strategically
reduces the search space. Our framework achieves superior planning performance,
generating high-quality state-action trajectories and surpassing existing
methods in challenging, contact-rich manipulation tasks such as non-prehensile
planar pushing with obstacles, object sorting, and rope routing in both
simulated and real-world settings. Furthermore, our framework supports various
neural network architectures, ranging from simple multilayer perceptrons to
advanced graph neural dynamics models, and scales efficiently with different
model sizes.

                                        <span>  Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as an innovative solution for
controlling legged robots in challenging environments using minimalist
architectures. Traditional control methods for legged robots, such as inverse
dynamics, either directly manage joint torques or use proportional-derivative
(PD) controllers to regulate joint positions at a higher level. In case of DRL,
direct torque control presents significant challenges, leading to a preference
for joint position control. However, this approach necessitates careful
adjustment of joint PD gains, which can limit both adaptability and efficiency.
In this paper, we propose GainAdaptor, an adaptive gain control framework that
autonomously tunes joint PD gains to enhance terrain adaptability and energy
efficiency. The framework employs a dual-actor algorithm to dynamically adjust
the PD gains based on varying ground conditions. By utilizing a divided action
space, GainAdaptor efficiently learns stable and energy-efficient locomotion.
We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments
conducted on a Unitree Go1 robot, demonstrating improved locomotion performance
across diverse terrains.

                                        <span>  Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are
versatile platforms widely used in applications such as surveillance, search
and rescue, and urban air mobility. Despite their potential, the critical
phases of take-off and landing in uncertain and dynamic environments pose
significant safety challenges due to environmental uncertainties, sensor noise,
and system-level interactions. This paper presents an integrated approach
combining vision-based sensor fusion with System-Theoretic Process Analysis
(STPA) to enhance the safety and robustness of VTOL UAV operations during
take-off and landing. By incorporating fiducial markers, such as AprilTags,
into the control architecture, and performing comprehensive hazard analysis, we
identify unsafe control actions and propose mitigation strategies. Key
contributions include developing the control structure with vision system
capable of identifying a fiducial marker, multirotor controller and
corresponding unsafe control actions and mitigation strategies. The proposed
solution is expected to improve the reliability and safety of VTOL UAV
operations, paving the way for resilient autonomous systems.

                                        <span>  Trajectory planning in robotics aims to generate collision-free pose
sequences that can be reliably executed. Recently, vision-to-planning systems
have garnered increasing attention for their efficiency and ability to
interpret and adapt to surrounding environments. However, traditional modular
systems suffer from increased latency and error propagation, while purely
data-driven approaches often overlook the robot's kinematic constraints. This
oversight leads to discrepancies between planned trajectories and those that
are executable. To address these challenges, we propose iKap, a novel
vision-to-planning system that integrates the robot's kinematic model directly
into the learning pipeline. iKap employs a self-supervised learning approach
and incorporates the state transition model within a differentiable bi-level
optimization framework. This integration ensures the network learns
collision-free waypoints while satisfying kinematic constraints, enabling
gradient back-propagation for end-to-end training. Our experimental results
demonstrate that iKap achieves higher success rates and reduced latency
compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Besides the complete system, iKap
offers a visual-to-planning network that seamlessly integrates kinematics into
various controllers, providing a robust solution for robots navigating complex
and dynamic environments.

a challenge due to the limitations of model-agnostic approaches. This study
addresses this gap by introducing an online nonlinear programming trajectory

                                        <span>  Robot decision-making in partially observable, real-time, dynamic, and
multi-agent environments remains a difficult and unsolved challenge. Model-free
reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach to learning decision-making
in such domains, however, end-to-end RL in complex environments is often
intractable. To address this challenge in the RoboCup Standard Platform League
(SPL) domain, we developed a novel architecture integrating RL within a
classical robotics stack, while employing a multi-fidelity sim2real approach
and decomposing behavior into learned sub-behaviors with heuristic selection.
Our architecture led to victory in the 2024 RoboCup SPL Challenge Shield
Division. In this work, we fully describe our system's architecture and
empirically analyze key design decisions that contributed to its success. Our
approach demonstrates how RL-based behaviors can be integrated into complete
robot behavior architectures.

                                        <span>  With the rapid development of green energy, the efficiency and reliability of
wind turbines are key to sustainable renewable energy production. For that
reason, this paper presents a novel intelligent system architecture designed
for the dynamic collection and real-time processing of visual data to detect
defects in wind turbines. The system employs advanced algorithms within a
distributed framework to enhance inspection accuracy and efficiency using
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with integrated visual and thermal sensors. An
experimental study conducted at the "Staryi Sambir-1" wind power plant in
Ukraine demonstrates the system's effectiveness, showing a significant
improvement in defect detection accuracy (up to 94%) and a reduction in
inspection time per turbine (down to 1.5 hours) compared to traditional
methods. The results show that the proposed intelligent system architecture
provides a scalable and reliable solution for wind turbine maintenance,
contributing to the durability and performance of renewable energy
infrastructure.

                                        <span>  Diffusion models have recently gained popularity for policy learning in
robotics due to their ability to capture high-dimensional and multimodal
distributions. However, diffusion policies are inherently stochastic and
typically trained offline, limiting their ability to handle unseen and dynamic
conditions where novel constraints not represented in the training data must be
satisfied. To overcome this limitation, we propose diffusion predictive control
with constraints (DPCC), an algorithm for diffusion-based control with explicit
state and action constraints that can deviate from those in the training data.
DPCC uses constraint tightening and incorporates model-based projections into
the denoising process of a trained trajectory diffusion model. This allows us
to generate constraint-satisfying, dynamically feasible, and goal-reaching
trajectories for predictive control. We show through simulations of a robot
manipulator that DPCC outperforms existing methods in satisfying novel
test-time constraints while maintaining performance on the learned control
task.

                                        <span>  Current robot learning algorithms for acquiring novel skills often rely on
demonstration datasets or environment interactions, resulting in high labor
costs and potential safety risks. To address these challenges, this study
proposes a skill-learning framework that enables robots to acquire novel skills
from natural language instructions. The proposed pipeline leverages
vision-language models to generate demonstration videos of novel skills, which
are processed by an inverse dynamics model to extract actions from the
unlabeled demonstrations. These actions are subsequently mapped to
environmental contexts via imitation learning, enabling robots to learn new
skills effectively. Experimental evaluations in the MetaWorld simulation
environments demonstrate the pipeline's capability to generate high-fidelity
and reliable demonstrations. Using the generated demonstrations, various skill
learning algorithms achieve an accomplishment rate three times the original on
novel tasks. These results highlight a novel approach to robot learning,
offering a foundation for the intuitive and intelligent acquisition of novel
robotic skills.

diffusion-based policies, known for modeling complex robotic trajectories.
However, their prolonged inference times hinder high-frequency control tasks
requiring real-time feedback. While consistency distillation (CD) accelerates
inference, it introduces errors that compromise action quality. To address
these limitations, we propose the Score and Distribution Matching Policy (SDM
Policy), which transforms diffusion-based policies into single-step generators
through a two-stage optimization process: score matching ensures alignment with
true action distributions, and distribution matching minimizes KL divergence
for consistency. A dual-teacher mechanism integrates a frozen teacher for
stability and an unfrozen teacher for adversarial training, enhancing
robustness and alignment with target distributions. Evaluated on a 57-task
simulation benchmark, SDM Policy achieves a 6x inference speedup while having
state-of-the-art action quality, providing an efficient and reliable framework
for high-frequency robotic tasks.

                                        <span>  Imitation learning with a privileged teacher has proven effective for
learning complex control behaviors from high-dimensional inputs, such as
images. In this framework, a teacher is trained with privileged task
information, while a student tries to predict the actions of the teacher with
more limited observations, e.g., in a robot navigation task, the teacher might
have access to distances to nearby obstacles, while the student only receives
visual observations of the scene. However, privileged imitation learning faces
a key challenge: the student might be unable to imitate the teacher's behavior
due to partial observability. This problem arises because the teacher is
trained without considering if the student is capable of imitating the learned
behavior. To address this teacher-student asymmetry, we propose a framework for
joint training of the teacher and student policies, encouraging the teacher to
learn behaviors that can be imitated by the student despite the latters'
limited access to information and its partial observability. Based on the
performance bound in imitation learning, we add (i) the approximated action
difference between teacher and student as a penalty term to the reward function
of the teacher, and (ii) a supervised teacher-student alignment step. We
motivate our method with a maze navigation task and demonstrate its
effectiveness on complex vision-based quadrotor flight and manipulation tasks.

                                        <span>  We propose MMD-OPT: a sample-efficient approach for minimizing the risk of
collision under arbitrary prediction distribution of the dynamic obstacles.
MMD-OPT is based on embedding distribution in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space
(RKHS) and the associated Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We show how these two
concepts can be used to define a sample efficient surrogate for collision risk
estimate. We perform extensive simulations to validate the effectiveness of
MMD-OPT on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Importantly, we show that
trajectory optimization with our MMD-based collision risk surrogate leads to
safer trajectories at low sample regimes than popular alternatives based on
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).

                                        <span>  With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, robotics, and Internet
of Things, multi-robot systems are progressively acquiring human-like
environmental perception and understanding capabilities, empowering them to
complete complex tasks through autonomous decision-making and interaction.
However, the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) faces significant challenges in
terms of spectrum resources, sensing accuracy, communication latency, and
energy supply. To address these issues, a reconfigurable intelligent surface
(RIS)-aided IoRT network is proposed to enhance the overall performance of
robotic communication, sensing, computation, and energy harvesting. In the case
studies, by jointly optimizing parameters such as transceiver beamforming,
robot trajectories, and RIS coefficients, solutions based on multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning and multi-objective optimization are proposed to solve
problems such as beamforming design, path planning, target sensing, and data
aggregation. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of
proposed solutions in improve communication quality, sensing accuracy,
computation error, and energy efficiency of RIS-aided IoRT networks.

isolation, and estimation (FDIE) for a class of wafer handler (WH) robots. The
proposed hybrid scheme consists of: 1) a linear filter that simultaneously
estimates system states and fault-induced signals from sensing and actuation
data; and 2) a data-driven classifier, in the form of a support vector machine
(SVM), that detects and isolates the fault type using estimates generated by
the filter. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme for two critical
fault types for WH robots used in the semiconductor industry: broken-belt in
the lower arm of the WH robot (an abrupt fault) and tilt in the robot arms (an
incipient fault). We derive explicit models of the robot motion dynamics
induced by these faults and test the diagnostics scheme in a realistic
simulation-based case study. These case study results demonstrate that the
proposed hybrid FDIE scheme achieves superior performance compared to purely
data-driven methods.

we present a new hybrid systems framework capturing the interconnected dynamics
underlying these interactions. The framework accommodates models arising from
both the autonomous systems and cognitive psychology literature in order to
represent key elements such as human trust in the autonomous system. The
intermittent nature of human interactions are incorporated by asynchronous
event-triggered sampling at the framework's human-autonomous system interfaces.
We illustrate important considerations for tuning framework parameters by
investigating a practical application to an autonomous robotic swarm search and

assist in designing more efficient and effective interactions between humans

                                        <span>  Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have the potential to provide transformative
control in prosthetics, assistive technologies (wheelchairs), robotics, and
human-computer interfaces. While Motor Imagery (MI) offers an intuitive
approach to BCI control, its practical implementation is often limited by the
requirement for expensive devices, extensive training data, and complex
algorithms, leading to user fatigue and reduced accessibility. In this paper,
we demonstrate that effective MI-BCI control of a mobile robot in real-world
settings can be achieved using a fine-tuned Deep Neural Network (DNN) with a
sliding window, eliminating the need for complex feature extractions for
real-time robot control. The fine-tuning process optimizes the convolutional
and attention layers of the DNN to adapt to each user's daily MI data streams,
reducing training data by 70% and minimizing user fatigue from extended data
collection. Using a low-cost (~$3k), 16-channel, non-invasive, open-source
electroencephalogram (EEG) device, four users teleoperated a quadruped robot
over three days. The system achieved 78% accuracy on a single-day validation
dataset and maintained a 75% validation accuracy over three days without
extensive retraining from day-to-day. For real-world robot command
classification, we achieved an average of 62% accuracy. By providing empirical
evidence that MI-BCI systems can maintain performance over multiple days with
reduced training data to DNN and a low-cost EEG device, our work enhances the
practicality and accessibility of BCI technology. This advancement makes BCI
applications more feasible for real-world scenarios, particularly in
controlling robotic systems.

in engineering and computer science. Orientational data appear as sets of
angles, unit vectors, rotation matrices or quaternions. In the field of
directional statistics, a lot of advances have been made in modelling such
types of data. However, only a few of these tools are used in engineering and
computer science applications. Hence, this paper aims to serve as a cheat sheet
for those probability distributions of orientations. Models for 1-DOF, 2-DOF
and 3-DOF orientations are discussed. For each of them, expressions for the
density function, fitting to data, and sampling are presented. The paper is
written with a compromise between engineering and statistics in terms of
notation and terminology. A Python library with functions for some of these
models is provided. Using this library, two examples of applications to real
data are presented.

high-temporal resolution compared to intensity cameras. Recent work has focused
on fusing the event measurements with inertial measurements to enable
ego-motion estimation in high-speed and HDR environments. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on IMU preintegration designed mainly for
synchronous sensors and discrete-time frameworks. In this paper, we propose a
continuous-time preintegration method based on the Temporal Gaussian Process
(TGP) called GPO. Concretely, we model the preintegration as a time-indexed
motion trajectory and leverage an efficient two-step optimization to initialize
the precision preintegration pseudo-measurements. Our method realizes a linear
and constant time cost for initialization and query, respectively. To further
validate the proposal, we leverage the GPO to design an asynchronous
event-inertial odometry and compare with other asynchronous fusion schemes
within the same odometry system. Experiments conducted on both public and
own-collected datasets demonstrate that the proposed GPO offers significant
advantages in terms of precision and efficiency, outperforming existing
approaches in handling asynchronous sensor fusion.

                                        <span>  Autonomous racing extends beyond the challenge of controlling a racecar at
its physical limits. Professional racers employ strategic maneuvers to outwit
other competing opponents to secure victory. While modern control algorithms
can achieve human-level performance by computing offline racing lines for
single-car scenarios, research on real-time algorithms for multi-car autonomous
racing is limited. To bridge this gap, we develop game-theoretic modeling
framework that incorporates the competitive aspect of autonomous racing like
overtaking and blocking through a novel policy parametrization, while operating
the car at its limit. Furthermore, we propose an algorithmic approach to
compute the (approximate) Nash equilibrium strategy, which represents the
optimal approach in the presence of competing agents. Specifically, we
introduce an algorithm inspired by recently introduced framework of dynamic
near-potential function, enabling real-time computation of the Nash
equilibrium. Our approach comprises two phases: offline and online. During the
offline phase, we use simulated racing data to learn a near-potential function
that approximates utility changes for agents. This function facilitates the
online computation of approximate Nash equilibria by maximizing its value. We
evaluate our method in a head-to-head 3-car racing scenario, demonstrating
superior performance compared to several existing baselines.

                                        <span>  Recent advances in Behavior Cloning (BC) have made it easy to teach robots
new tasks. However, we find that the ease of teaching comes at the cost of
unreliable performance that saturates with increasing data for tasks requiring
precision. The performance saturation can be attributed to two critical
factors: (a) distribution shift resulting from the use of offline data and (b)
the lack of closed-loop corrective control caused by action chucking
(predicting a set of future actions executed open-loop) critical for BC
performance. Our key insight is that by predicting action chunks, BC policies
function more like trajectory "planners" than closed-loop controllers necessary
for reliable execution. To address these challenges, we devise a simple yet
effective method, ResiP (Residual for Precise Manipulation), that overcomes the
reliability problem while retaining BC's ease of teaching and long-horizon
capabilities. ResiP augments a frozen, chunked BC model with a fully
closed-loop residual policy trained with reinforcement learning (RL) that
addresses distribution shifts and introduces closed-loop corrections over
open-loop execution of action chunks predicted by the BC trajectory planner.

                                        <span>  A crucial challenge in decentralized systems is state estimation in the
presence of unknown inputs, particularly within heterogeneous sensor networks
with dynamic topologies. While numerous consensus algorithms have been
introduced, they often require extensive information exchange or multiple
communication iterations to ensure estimation accuracy. This paper proposes an
efficient algorithm that achieves an unbiased and optimal solution comparable
to filters with full information about other agents. This is accomplished
through the use of information filter decomposition and the fusion of inputs
via covariance intersection. Our method requires only a single communication
iteration for exchanging individual estimates between agents, instead of
multiple rounds of information exchange, thus preserving agents' privacy by
avoiding the sharing of explicit observations and system equations.
Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by dynamic communication
topologies, we propose two practical strategies to handle issues arising from
intermittent observations and incomplete state estimation, thereby enhancing
the robustness and accuracy of the estimation process. Experiments and ablation
studies conducted in both stationary and dynamic environments demonstrate the
superiority of our algorithm over other baselines. Notably, it performs as well
as, or even better than, algorithms that have a global view of all neighbors.

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). While DRL has significantly advanced bipedal
locomotion, the development of a unified framework capable of handling a wide
range of tasks remains an ongoing challenge. This survey systematically
categorises, compares, and analyses existing DRL frameworks for bipedal
locomotion, organising them into end-to-end and hierarchical control schemes.
End-to-end frameworks are evaluated based on their learning approaches, while
hierarchical frameworks are examined in terms of layered structures that
integrate learning-based or traditional model-based methods. We provide a
detailed evaluation of the composition, strengths, limitations, and
capabilities of each framework. Additionally, this survey identifies key
research gaps and proposes future directions aimed at creating a more

generation of safety-critical scenarios, which are essential to ensure that AVs

velocity trajectory planner. First, the detection network estimates the objects
position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized
and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory
planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system.
This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are
taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and
velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly
influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to
different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic.
We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without
clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute

                                        <span>  Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for robotics
applications, particularly task planning, by harnessing their language
comprehension and text generation capabilities. However, in applications such
as household robotics, a critical gap remains in the personalization of these
models to individual user preferences. We introduce LLM-Personalize, a novel
framework with an optimization pipeline designed to personalize LLM planners
for household robotics. Our LLM-Personalize framework features an LLM planner
that performs iterative planning in multi-room, partially-observable household
scenarios, making use of a scene graph constructed with local observations. The
generated plan consists of a sequence of high-level actions which are
subsequently executed by a controller. Central to our approach is the
optimization pipeline, which combines imitation learning and iterative
self-training to personalize the LLM planner. In particular, the imitation
learning phase performs initial LLM alignment from demonstrations, and
bootstraps the model to facilitate effective iterative self-training, which
further explores and aligns the model to user preferences. We evaluate
LLM-Personalize on Housekeep, a challenging simulated real-world 3D benchmark
for household rearrangements, and show that LLM-Personalize achieves more than
a 30 percent increase in success rate over existing LLM planners, showcasing
significantly improved alignment with human preferences. Project page:

Popular choices for dense representations exploit Truncated Signed Distance
Functions (TSDF) and Octree data structures. However, TSDF provides a
projective or non-projective signed distance obtained directly from depth
measurements that overestimate the Euclidean distance. Octrees, despite being
memory efficient, require tree traversal and can lead to increased runtime in
large scenarios. Other representations based on the Gaussian Process (GP)
distance fields are appealing due to their probabilistic and continuous nature,
but the computational complexity is a concern. In this paper, we present an
online efficient mapping framework that seamlessly couples GP distance fields
and the fast-access OpenVDB data structure. The key aspect is a latent Local GP
Signed Distance Field (L-GPDF) contained in a local VDB structure that allows
fast queries of the Euclidean distance, surface properties and their
uncertainties for arbitrary points in the field of view. Probabilistic fusion
is then performed by merging the inferred values of these points into a global
VDB structure that is efficiently maintained over time. After fusion, the
surface mesh is recovered, and a global GP Signed Distance Field (G-GPDF) is
generated and made available for downstream applications to query accurate
distance and gradients. A comparison with the state-of-the-art frameworks shows
superior efficiency and accuracy of the inferred distance field and comparable
reconstruction performance. https://github.com/UTS-RI/VDB_GPDF

                                        <span>  Offline data are both valuable and practical resources for teaching robots
complex behaviors. Ideally, learning agents should not be constrained by the
scarcity of available demonstrations, but rather generalize beyond the training
distribution. However, the complexity of real-world scenarios typically
requires huge amounts of data to prevent neural network policies from picking
up on spurious correlations and learning non-causal relationships. We propose
CAIAC, a data augmentation method that can create feasible synthetic
transitions from a fixed dataset without having access to online environment
interactions. By utilizing principled methods for quantifying causal influence,
we are able to perform counterfactual reasoning by swapping
$\it{action}$-unaffected parts of the state-space between independent
trajectories in the dataset. We empirically show that this leads to a
substantial increase in robustness of offline learning algorithms against
distributional shift.

                                        <span>  Globally-consistent localization in urban environments is crucial for
autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles and drones, as well as
assistive technologies for visually impaired people. Traditional
Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(VSLAM) methods, though adequate for local pose estimation, suffer from drift
in the long term due to reliance on local sensor data. While GPS counteracts
this drift, it is unavailable indoors and often unreliable in urban areas. An
alternative is to localize the camera to an existing 3D map using
visual-feature matching. This can provide centimeter-level accurate
localization but is limited by the visual similarities between the current view
and the map. This paper introduces a novel approach that achieves accurate and
globally-consistent localization by aligning the sparse 3D point cloud
generated by the VIO/VSLAM system to a digital twin using point-to-plane
matching; no visual data association is needed. The proposed method provides a
6-DoF global measurement tightly integrated into the VIO/VSLAM system.
Experiments run on a high-fidelity GPS simulator and real-world data collected
from a drone demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art VIO-GPS
systems and offers superior robustness against viewpoint changes compared to
the state-of-the-art Visual SLAM systems.

                                        <span>  The widespread adoption of quadrotors for diverse applications, from
agriculture to public safety, necessitates an understanding of the aerodynamic
disturbances they create. This paper introduces a computationally lightweight
model for estimating the time-averaged magnitude of the induced flow below
quadrotors in hover. Unlike related approaches that rely on expensive
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations or drone specific time-consuming
empirical measurements, our method leverages classical theory from turbulent
flows. By analyzing over 16 hours of flight data from drones of varying sizes
within a large motion capture system, we show for the first time that the
combined flow from all drone propellers is well-approximated by a turbulent jet
after 2.5 drone-diameters below the vehicle. Using a novel normalization and
scaling, we experimentally identify model parameters that describe a unified
mean velocity field below differently sized quadrotors. The model, which
requires only the drone's mass, propeller size, and drone size for
calculations, accurately describes the far-field airflow over a long-range in a
very large volume which is impractical to simulate using CFD. Our model offers
a practical tool for ensuring safer operations near humans, optimizing sensor
placements and drone control in multi-agent scenarios. We demonstrate the
latter by designing a controller that compensates for the downwash of another
drone, leading to a four times lower altitude deviation when passing below.

                                        <span>  Robotic tasks such as planning and navigation require a hierarchical semantic
understanding of a scene, which could include multiple floors and rooms.
Current methods primarily focus on object segmentation for 3D scene
understanding. However, such methods struggle to segment out topological
regions like "kitchen" in the scene. In this work, we introduce a two-step
pipeline to solve this problem. First, we extract a topological map, i.e.,
floorplan of the indoor scene using a novel multi-channel occupancy
representation. Then, we generate CLIP-aligned features and semantic labels for
every room instance based on the objects it contains using a self-attention
transformer. Our language-topology alignment supports natural language
querying, e.g., a "place to cook" locates the "kitchen". We outperform the
current state-of-the-art on room segmentation by ~20% and room classification
by ~12%. Our detailed qualitative analysis and ablation studies provide
insights into the problem of joint structural and semantic 3D scene
understanding. Project Page: quest-maps.github.io

                                        <span>  Dynamic graphs are extensively employed for detecting anomalous behavior in
nodes within the Internet of Things (IoT). Graph generative models are often
used to address the issue of imbalanced node categories in dynamic graphs.
Nevertheless, the constraints it faces include the monotonicity of adjacency
relationships, the difficulty in constructing multi-dimensional features for
nodes, and the lack of a method for end-to-end generation of multiple
categories of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel graph generation model,
called CGGM, specifically for generating samples belonging to the minority
class. The framework consists two core module: a conditional graph generation
module and a graph-based anomaly detection module. The generative module adapts
to the sparsity of the matrix by downsampling a noise adjacency matrix, and
incorporates a multi-dimensional feature encoder based on multi-head
self-attention to capture latent dependencies among features. Additionally, a
latent space constraint is combined with the distribution distance to
approximate the latent distribution of real data. The graph-based anomaly
detection module utilizes the generated balanced dataset to predict the node
behaviors. Extensive experiments have shown that CGGM outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and divergence. The results also
demonstrate CGGM can generated diverse data categories, that enhancing the
performance of multi-category classification task.

and interpretation capabilities in Autonomous Driving (AD) by incorporating
large language models. Despite the advancements, current data-driven AD
approaches tend to concentrate on a single dataset and specific tasks,
neglecting their overall capabilities and ability to generalize. To bridge
these gaps, we propose DriveMM, a general large multimodal model designed to
process diverse data inputs, such as images and multi-view videos, while
performing a broad spectrum of AD tasks, including perception, prediction, and
planning. Initially, the model undergoes curriculum pre-training to process
varied visual signals and perform basic visual comprehension and perception
tasks. Subsequently, we augment and standardize various AD-related datasets to
fine-tune the model, resulting in an all-in-one LMM for autonomous driving. To
assess the general capabilities and generalization ability, we conduct
evaluations on six public benchmarks and undertake zero-shot transfer on an
unseen dataset, where DriveMM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all
tasks. We hope DriveMM as a promising solution for future end-to-end autonomous
driving applications in the real world. Project page with code:

                                        <span>  We study decentralized multiagent optimization over networks, modeled as
undirected graphs. The optimization problem consists of minimizing a nonconvex
smooth function plus a convex extended-value function, which enforces
constraints or extra structure on the solution (e.g., sparsity, low-rank). We
further assume that the objective function satisfies the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz
(KL) property, with given exponent $\theta\in [0,1)$. The KL property is
satisfied by several (nonconvex) functions of practical interest, e.g., arising
from machine learning applications; in the centralized setting, it permits to
achieve strong convergence guarantees. Here we establish convergence of the
same type for the notorious decentralized gradient-tracking-based algorithm
SONATA. Specifically, $\textbf{(i)}$ when $\theta\in (0,1/2]$, the sequence
generated by SONATA converges to a stationary solution of the problem at
R-linear rate;$ \textbf{(ii)} $when $\theta\in (1/2,1)$, sublinear rate is
certified; and finally $\textbf{(iii)}$ when $\theta=0$, the iterates will
either converge in a finite number of steps or converges at R-linear rate. This
matches the convergence behavior of centralized proximal-gradient algorithms
except when $\theta=0$. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings.

utilizes machine learning (ML) techniques to forecast energy usage in the pure
electric mode of the vehicle and optimize power allocation across different
operational modes, including pure electric, series hybrid, parallel hybrid, and
internal combustion operation. The fuzzy logic decision-making process governs
the vehicle control system. The performance was assessed under various driving
conditions. Key findings include a significant enhancement in pure electric
mode efficiency, achieving an extended full-electric range of approximately 84
kilometers on an 80% utilization of a 20-kWh battery pack. During the WLTC
driving cycle, the control system reduced fuel consumption to 2.86 L/100km,
representing a 20% reduction in gasoline-equivalent fuel consumption.
Evaluations of vehicle performance at discrete driving speeds, highlighted
effective energy management, with the vehicle battery charging at lower speeds
and discharging at higher speeds, showing optimized energy recovery and
consumption strategies. Initial battery charge levels notably influenced
vehicle performance. A 90% initial charge enabled prolonged all-electric
operation, minimizing fuel consumption to 2 L/100km less than that of the base
control system. Real-world driving pattern analysis revealed significant
variations, with shorter, slower cycles requiring lower fuel consumption due to
prioritized electric propulsion, while longer, faster cycles increased internal
combustion engine usage. The control system also adapted to different battery
state of health (SOH) conditions, with higher SOH facilitating extended
electric mode usage, reducing total fuel consumption by up to 2.87 L/100km.

                                        <span>  Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) is vital for identifying modal parameters
under real-world conditions, yet existing methods often face challenges with
noise sensitivity and stability. This work introduces NExT-LF, a novel method
that combines the well-known Natural Excitation Technique (NExT) with the
Loewner Framework (LF). NExT enables the extraction of Impulse Response
Functions (IRFs) from output-only vibration data, which are then converted into
the frequency domain and used by LF to estimate modal parameters. The proposed
method is validated through numerical and experimental case studies. In the
numerical study of a 2D Euler-Bernoulli cantilever beam, NExT-LF provides
results consistent with analytical solutions and those from the benchmark
method, NExT with Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (NExT-ERA). Additionally,
NExT-LF demonstrates superior noise robustness, reliably identifying stable
modes across various noise levels where NExT-ERA fails. Experimental validation
on the Sheraton Universal Hotel is the first OMA application to this structure,
confirming NExT-LF as a robust and efficient method for output-only modal
parameter identification.

wind turbines are key to sustainable renewable energy production. For that
reason, this paper presents a novel intelligent system architecture designed
for the dynamic collection and real-time processing of visual data to detect
defects in wind turbines. The system employs advanced algorithms within a
distributed framework to enhance inspection accuracy and efficiency using
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with integrated visual and thermal sensors. An
experimental study conducted at the "Staryi Sambir-1" wind power plant in
Ukraine demonstrates the system's effectiveness, showing a significant
improvement in defect detection accuracy (up to 94%) and a reduction in
inspection time per turbine (down to 1.5 hours) compared to traditional
methods. The results show that the proposed intelligent system architecture
provides a scalable and reliable solution for wind turbine maintenance,
contributing to the durability and performance of renewable energy
infrastructure.

                                        <span>  Diffusion models have recently gained popularity for policy learning in
robotics due to their ability to capture high-dimensional and multimodal
distributions. However, diffusion policies are inherently stochastic and
typically trained offline, limiting their ability to handle unseen and dynamic
conditions where novel constraints not represented in the training data must be
satisfied. To overcome this limitation, we propose diffusion predictive control
with constraints (DPCC), an algorithm for diffusion-based control with explicit
state and action constraints that can deviate from those in the training data.
DPCC uses constraint tightening and incorporates model-based projections into
the denoising process of a trained trajectory diffusion model. This allows us
to generate constraint-satisfying, dynamically feasible, and goal-reaching
trajectories for predictive control. We show through simulations of a robot
manipulator that DPCC outperforms existing methods in satisfying novel
test-time constraints while maintaining performance on the learned control
task.

                                        <span>  With the increasing development of intelligent transportation systems and
advancements in aviation technology, the concept of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM)
is gaining attention. This study aims to improve operational safety and service
quality within Urban Air Mobility (UAM) through a trajectory-based operation
(TBO). A multi-layer operational risk assessment model is introduced to capture
the effects of aircraft failure scenarios on critical urban entities, including
ground personnel, vehicles, and in-flight UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles).
Based on this, a single-aircraft track planning model is designed to balance
operational risk and transportation cost under the performance constraints of
eVTOL (electric Vertical Take-off and Landing) aircraft. A customized track
planning algorithm with safety buffer zones is used to identify the most
efficient flight paths. Additionally, a multi-aircraft scheduling optimization
model is proposed to minimize delays and reduce mid-air collision risks.
Experimental results show that the presented approach improves both efficiency
and safety, providing practical solutions for UAM operations.

                                        <span>  Model Predictive Control (MPC) has demonstrated significant potential in
improving energy efficiency in building climate control, outperforming
traditional controllers commonly used in modern building management systems.
Among MPC variants, data-driven predictive control (DPC) offers the advantage
of modeling building dynamics directly from data, thereby substantially
reducing commissioning efforts. However, inevitable model uncertainties and
measurement noise can result in comfort violations, even with dedicated MPC
setups. This work introduces a disturbance-adaptive DPC (DAD-DPC) framework
designed to ensure asymptotic satisfaction of predefined violation bounds under
sufficient conditions. The framework employs a fully data-driven pipeline based
on Willems' Fundamental Lemma and conformal prediction for application in
building climate control. The proposed DAD-DPC framework was validated using
four building cases, leveraging a high-fidelity simulation platform, BOPTEST,
and an actual building testbed, Polydome. For a 5% violation bound, the
framework achieved energy consumption increases of 2.82%, 2.24%, 3.75%, and
5.09% while reducing comfort violations by 77.62%, 79.51%, 73.26%, and 39.76%,
respectively, compared to other controller configurations. These results
demonstrate the framework's ability to effectively balance energy consumption
and comfort violations, offering a practical solution for building climate
control applications.

power system stability, increasing vulnerability to frequency deviations due to
the lack of inertia. Current efforts to decarbonise electricity grids while
maintaining frequency security still rely on Ancillary Services (AS) provision,
such as inertia and frequency response, from flexible synchronous generators,
placing these type of units in an advantageous position in the AS market.
However, in the ongoing transition to decarbonisation, not enough attention has
been given to analysing market power in the frequency-containment AS market.
  This work presents a strategic bidding model designed to analyse market power
in the coupled energy and frequency-containment AS market. Through a non-convex
primal-dual bi-level formulation, we determine the interaction of a strategic
market player with the rest of the market that behaves competitively. The case
study is based on Great Britain in 2030, demonstrating the capacity of the
strategic player to influence prices. While this impact is perceived in the
energy market, it is particularly pronounced in the AS market.

                                        <span>  This work proposes a hybrid model- and data-based scheme for fault detection,
isolation, and estimation (FDIE) for a class of wafer handler (WH) robots. The
proposed hybrid scheme consists of: 1) a linear filter that simultaneously
estimates system states and fault-induced signals from sensing and actuation
data; and 2) a data-driven classifier, in the form of a support vector machine
(SVM), that detects and isolates the fault type using estimates generated by
the filter. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme for two critical
fault types for WH robots used in the semiconductor industry: broken-belt in
the lower arm of the WH robot (an abrupt fault) and tilt in the robot arms (an
incipient fault). We derive explicit models of the robot motion dynamics
induced by these faults and test the diagnostics scheme in a realistic
simulation-based case study. These case study results demonstrate that the
proposed hybrid FDIE scheme achieves superior performance compared to purely
data-driven methods.

speed and charging planning designed for connected electric vehicles (EVs).
With EVs emerging as competitive alternatives to internal combustion engine
vehicles, overcoming challenges such as limited charging infrastructure is
crucial. evS2CP addresses these issues by minimizing the travel time, charging
time, and energy consumption, providing practical solutions for both
human-operated and autonomous vehicles. This framework leverages V2X
communication to integrate essential EV planning data, including route
geometry, real-time traffic conditions, and charging station availability,
while simulating dynamic driving environments using open-web API services. The
speed and charging planning problem was initially formulated as a nonlinear
programming model, which was then convexified into a quadratic programming
model without charging-stop constraints. Additionally, a mixed-integer
programming approach was employed to optimize charging station selection and
minimize the frequency of charging events. A mixed-integer quadratic
programming implementation exhibited exceptional computational efficiency and
scalability, effectively solving trip plans over distances exceeding 700 km in
a few seconds. Simulations conducted using open-source and commercial solvers
validated the framework's near-global optimality, demonstrating its robustness
and feasibility for real-world applications in connected EV ecosystems.

                                        <span>  Embedded IoT system development is crucial for enabling seamless connectivity
and functionality across a wide range of applications. However, such a complex
process requires cross-domain knowledge of hardware and software and hence
often necessitates direct developer involvement, making it labor-intensive,
time-consuming, and error-prone. To address this challenge, this paper
introduces EmbedGenius, the first fully automated software development platform
for general-purpose embedded IoT systems. The key idea is to leverage the
reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and embedded system expertise
to automate the hardware-in-the-loop development process. The main methods
include a component-aware library resolution method for addressing hardware
dependencies, a library knowledge generation method that injects utility domain
knowledge into LLMs, and an auto-programming method that ensures successful
deployment. We evaluate EmbedGenius's performance across 71 modules and four
mainstream embedded development platforms with over 350 IoT tasks. Experimental
results show that EmbedGenius can generate codes with an accuracy of 95.7% and
complete tasks with a success rate of 86.5%, surpassing human-in-the-loop
baselines by 15.6%--37.7% and 25.5%--53.4%, respectively. We also show
EmbedGenius's potential through case studies in environmental monitoring and
remote control systems development.

subspaces defined by linear dynamical systems, leveraging optimization on the
Grassmannian manifold leading to the Grassmannian Recursive Algorithm for
Tracking (GREAT) method. The approach of representing linear systems by
non-parametric subspace models has received significant interest in the field
of data-driven control recently. We view subspaces as points on the
Grassmannian manifold, and therefore, tracking is achieved by performing
optimization on the manifold. At each time step, a single measurement from the
current subspace corrupted by a bounded error is available. The subspace
estimate is updated online using Grassmannian gradient descent on a cost
function incorporating a window of the most recent data. Under suitable
assumptions on the signal-to-noise ratio of the online data and the subspace's
rate of change, we establish theoretical guarantees for the resulting
algorithm. More specifically, we prove an exponential convergence rate and
provide a consistent uncertainty quantification of the estimates in terms of an
upper bound on their distance to the true subspace. The applicability of the
proposed algorithm is demonstrated by means of numerical examples, and it is
shown to compare favorably with competing parametric system identification
methods.

since the breakthrough in generalization brought about by BAIM techniques
mainly occurs in natural language processing, there is still a lack of a clear
technical roadmap on how to efficiently apply BAIM techniques to wireless

reviews recent research works on BAIM for wireless and assesses the current

between language intelligence and wireless intelligence on multiple levels,
including scientific foundations, core usages, and technical details. It
highlights the necessity and scientific significance of developing BAIM
technology in a wireless-native way, as well as new issues that need to be
considered in specific technical implementation. Finally, by synthesizing the
evolutionary laws of language models with the particularities of wireless
system, this paper provides several instructive methodologies for how to
develop wireless-native BAIM.

hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with Markov-jumping parameter
uncertainty. We consider a 2 x 2 heterogeneous hyperbolic PDE and propose a
control law using operator learning and backstepping method. Specifically, the
backstepping kernels used to construct the control law are approximated with
neural operators (NOs) in order to improve computational efficiency. The key
challenge lies in deriving the stability condition with respect to the
Markov-jumping parameter uncertainty and NO approximation errors. The
mean-square exponential stability of the stochastic system is achieved through
Lyapunov analysis, indicating that the system can be stabilized if the random
parameters are sufficiently close to the nominal parameters on average, and NO
approximation errors are small enough. The theoretical results are applied to
freeway traffic control under stochastic upstream demands and then validated
through numerical simulations.

                                        <span>  Inspired by the increased cooperation between humans and autonomous systems,
we present a new hybrid systems framework capturing the interconnected dynamics
underlying these interactions. The framework accommodates models arising from
both the autonomous systems and cognitive psychology literature in order to
represent key elements such as human trust in the autonomous system. The
intermittent nature of human interactions are incorporated by asynchronous
event-triggered sampling at the framework's human-autonomous system interfaces.
We illustrate important considerations for tuning framework parameters by
investigating a practical application to an autonomous robotic swarm search and
rescue scenario. In this way, we demonstrate how the proposed framework may
assist in designing more efficient and effective interactions between humans
and autonomous systems.

                                        <span>  Event cameras, as bio-inspired sensors, are asynchronously triggered with
high-temporal resolution compared to intensity cameras. Recent work has focused
on fusing the event measurements with inertial measurements to enable
ego-motion estimation in high-speed and HDR environments. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on IMU preintegration designed mainly for
synchronous sensors and discrete-time frameworks. In this paper, we propose a
continuous-time preintegration method based on the Temporal Gaussian Process
(TGP) called GPO. Concretely, we model the preintegration as a time-indexed
motion trajectory and leverage an efficient two-step optimization to initialize
the precision preintegration pseudo-measurements. Our method realizes a linear
and constant time cost for initialization and query, respectively. To further
validate the proposal, we leverage the GPO to design an asynchronous
event-inertial odometry and compare with other asynchronous fusion schemes
within the same odometry system. Experiments conducted on both public and
own-collected datasets demonstrate that the proposed GPO offers significant
advantages in terms of precision and efficiency, outperforming existing
approaches in handling asynchronous sensor fusion.

current loads and constant power loads) exist widely in power system. In order
to stabilize buck converter based DC distributed system with ZIP load, an
adaptive energy shaping controller (AESC) is devised in this paper. Firstly,
based on the assumption that lumped disturbances are known, a full information
controller is designed in the framework of the port Hamiltonian system via
energy shaping technique. Besides, using mathematical deductive method, an
estimation of the domain of attraction is given to ensure the strict stability.
Furthermore, to eliminate the influence of parameter perturbations on the
system, a disturbance observer is proposed to reconstruct the lumped
disturbances and then the estimated terms are introduced to above controller to
form an AESC scheme. In addition, the stability analysis of the closed-loop
system is given. Lastly, the simulation and experiment results are presented
for assessing the designed controller.

problems widely found in control systems engineering, robotics, and artificial
intelligence. This work investigates optimal control over a sequence of natural
images. The problem is formalized, and general conditions are derived for an
image to be sufficient for implementing an optimal policy. Reinforcement
learning is shown to be efficient only for certain types of image
representations. This is demonstrated by developing a reinforcement learning
benchmark that scales easily with number of states and length of horizon, and
has optimal policies that are easily distinguished from suboptimal policies.
Image representations given by overcomplete sparse codes are found to be
computationally efficient for optimal control, using fewer computational
resources to learn and evaluate optimal policies. For natural images of fixed
size, representing each image as an overcomplete sparse code in a linear
network is shown to increase network storage capacity by orders of magnitude
beyond that possible for any complete code, allowing larger tasks with many
more states to be solved. Sparse codes can be generated by devices with low
energy requirements and low computational overhead.

network is critical to the continuity and reliability of energy delivery. In
this paper, we study a dynamic model for synchronization in the proposed power
network which the National Aeronautic and Space Agency plans to build on the
lunar surface to support continuous human presence on the Moon and a lunar
economy. This network is quite remarkable in the sense that it is expected to
be the first power network to operate at the unprecedented operating frequency
in the $\text{kHz}$ range. The particular structure of this network allows us
to derive the necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing the existence of
a unique locally stable synchronized mode, which will provide a passive control
mechanism for the system. Furthermore, we study the bifurcation process leading
to the loss of synchronization when the system parameters fall outside of the
stable regime. Our results have broader implications for many complex networks
with parametric heterogeneity to enhance stability and resilience.

                                        <span>  A crucial challenge in decentralized systems is state estimation in the
presence of unknown inputs, particularly within heterogeneous sensor networks
with dynamic topologies. While numerous consensus algorithms have been
introduced, they often require extensive information exchange or multiple
communication iterations to ensure estimation accuracy. This paper proposes an
efficient algorithm that achieves an unbiased and optimal solution comparable
to filters with full information about other agents. This is accomplished
through the use of information filter decomposition and the fusion of inputs
via covariance intersection. Our method requires only a single communication
iteration for exchanging individual estimates between agents, instead of
multiple rounds of information exchange, thus preserving agents' privacy by
avoiding the sharing of explicit observations and system equations.
Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by dynamic communication
topologies, we propose two practical strategies to handle issues arising from
intermittent observations and incomplete state estimation, thereby enhancing

studies conducted in both stationary and dynamic environments demonstrate the
superiority of our algorithm over other baselines. Notably, it performs as well
as, or even better than, algorithms that have a global view of all neighbors.

                                        <span>  Most existing necessary conditions for optimal control based on adjoining
methods require both state and costate information, yet the unobservability of
costates for a given feasible trajectory impedes the determination of
optimality in practice. This paper establishes a novel theoretical framework
for time-optimal control of controllable linear systems with a single input,
proposing the augmented switching law (ASL) that represents the input control
and the feasibility in a compact form. Given a feasible trajectory, the
perturbed trajectory under the constraints of ASL is guaranteed to be feasible,
resulting in a novel state-centric necessary condition without dependence on
costate information. A first-order necessary condition is proposed that the
Jacobian matrix of the ASL is not full row rank, which also results in a
potential approach to optimizing a given feasible trajectory with the
preservation of arc structures. The proposed necessary condition is applied to
high-order chain-of-integrator systems with full box constraints, contributing
to some theoretical results challenging to reason by costate-based conditions.

information in connected and autonomous vehicles. In particular, we relate this
delay's effect on the selection of the time headway in predecessor-follower
type vehicle platooning with a constant time headway policy (CTHP). We employ a
CTHP control law for each vehicle in the platoon by considering two cases:
cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) strategy where information from only
one predecessor vehicle is employed and CACC+ where information from multiple
predecessor vehicles is employed. We investigate how the lower bound on the
time headway is affected by signal transmission delay due to wireless
communication. We provide a systematic approach to the derivation of the lower
bound of the time headway and selection of the appropriate CTHP controller
gains for predecessor acceleration, velocity error and spacing error which will
ensure robust string stability of the platoon under the presence of signal
delay. We corroborate the main result with numerical simulations.

                                        <span>  In this paper, a new model-free anomaly detection framework is proposed for
time-series induced by industrial dynamical systems.The framework lies in the
category of conventional approaches which enable appealing features such as a
learning with reduced amount of training data, a high potential for
explainability as well as a compatibility with incremental learning mechanism
to incorporate operator feedback after an alarm is raised and analyzed.
Although these are crucial features towards acceptance of data-driven solutions
by industry, they are rarely considered in the comparisons that generally
almost exclusively focus on performance metrics. Moreover, the features
engineering step involved in the proposed framework is inspired by the
time-series being implicitly governed by physical laws as it is generally the
case in industrial time-series. Two examples are given to assess the efficiency
of the proposed approach.

                                        <span>  The growing complexity of power system management has led to an increased
interest in reinforcement learning (RL). However, vanilla RL controllers cannot
themselves ensure satisfaction of system constraints. Therefore, combining them
with formally correct safeguarding mechanisms is an important aspect when
studying RL for power system management. Integrating safeguarding into complex
use cases requires tool support. To address this need, we introduce the Python
tool CommonPower. CommonPower's unique contribution lies in its symbolic
modeling approach, which enables flexible, model-based safeguarding of RL
controllers. Moreover, CommonPower offers a unified interface for single-agent
RL, multi-agent RL, and optimal control, with seamless integration of different
forecasting methods. This allows users to validate the effectiveness of safe RL
controllers across a large variety of case studies and investigate the
influence of specific aspects on overall performance. We demonstrate
CommonPower's versatility through a numerical case study that compares RL
agents featuring different safeguards with a model predictive controller in the
context of building energy management.

represented as Transient Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow (TSC-OPF).
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based TSC-OPF trains efficient
decision-making agents that are adaptable to various scenarios and provide
solution results quickly. However, due to the high dimensionality of the state
space and action spaces, as well as the non-smoothness of dynamic constraints,
existing DRL-based TSC-OPF solution methods face a significant challenge of the
sparse reward problem. To address this issue, a fast-converged DRL method for
TSC-OPF is proposed in this paper. The Markov Decision Process (MDP) modeling
of TSC-OPF is improved by reducing the observation space and smoothing the
reward design, thus facilitating agent training. An improved Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient algorithm with Curriculum learning, Parallel exploration, and
Ensemble decision-making (DDPG-CPEn) is introduced to drastically enhance the
efficiency of agent training and the accuracy of decision-making. The
effectiveness, efficiency, and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated
through experiments in the IEEE 39-bus system and a practical 710-bus regional
power grid. The source code of the proposed method is made public on GitHub.

functions and the classical Loewner framework based on the Loewner pencil in
the case of bilinear systems. New Loewner functions are defined based on the
bilinear Loewner framework, and a Loewner equivalent model is produced using
these functions. This model is composed of infinite series that needs to be
truncated in order to be implemented in practice. In this context, a new notion
of approximate Loewner equivalence is introduced. In the end, it is shown that
the moment matching procedure based on the proposed Loewner functions and the
classical interpolatory bilinear Loewner framework both result in
$\kappa$-Loewner equivalent models, the main difference being that the latter
preserves bilinearity at the expense of a higher order.

                                        <span>  By providing various services, such as Demand Response (DR), buildings can
play a crucial role in the energy market due to their significant energy
consumption. However, effectively commissioning buildings for such desired
functionalities requires significant expert knowledge and design effort,
considering the variations in building dynamics and intended use. In this
study, we introduce an adaptive data-driven prediction scheme based on Willems'
Fundamental Lemma within the building control hierarchy. This scheme offers a
versatile, flexible, and user-friendly interface for diverse prediction and
control objectives. We provide an easy-to-use tuning process and an adaptive
update pipeline for the scheme, both validated through extensive prediction
tests. We evaluate the proposed scheme by coordinating a building and an energy
storage system to provide Secondary Frequency Control (SFC) in a Swiss DR
program. Specifically, we integrate the scheme into a three-layer hierarchical
SFC control framework, and each layer of this hierarchy is designed to achieve
distinct operational goals. Apart from its flexibility, our approach
significantly improves cost efficiency, resulting in a 28.74% reduction in
operating costs compared to a conventional control scheme, as demonstrated by a
52-day experiment in an actual building. Our findings emphasize the potential
of the proposed scheme to reduce the commissioning costs of advanced building
control strategies and to facilitate the adoption of new techniques in building
control.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes a decision-making approach for the control of
distribution systems with distributed energy resources (DERs) equipped with
photovoltaic (PV) units and battery energy storage systems (BESS). The
objective is to minimize the total operational cost of the distribution system
while satisfying the system operating constraints. The method is based on the
discrete-time finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. Different
aspects of the distribution system operation are considered, such as the
possibilities of curtailment of PV generation, managing battery storage,
reactive power injection, load shedding, and providing a flexibility service
for the transmission system. The model is tested for the IEEE 33-bus system
with two added DERs and the study cases involve various unexpected events. The
experimental results show that this method enables the attainment of relatively
low total cost values compared to the reference deterministic approach. The
benefits of applying this approach are particularly evident when there is a
significant difference between the predicted and actual PV power generation.

                                        <span>  The problem of reconciling a prior probability law on paths with data was
introduced by E. Schr\"odinger in 1931/32. It represents an early formulation
of a maximum likelihood problem. This specific formulation can also be seen as
the control problem to modify the law of a diffusion process so as to match
specifications on marginal distributions at given times. Thereby, in recent
years, this so-called Schr\"odinger's bridge problem has been at the center of
the uncertainty control development. However, an understudied facet of this
program has been to address uncertainty in space (state) and time, modeling the
effect of tasks being completed contingent on meeting a certain condition at
some random time instead of imposing specifications at fixed times. The present
work is a study to extend Schr\"odinger's paradigm on such an issue, and
herein, it is tackled in the context of random walks on directed graphs.
Specifically, we study the case where one marginal is the initial probability
distribution on a Markov chain, while others are marginals of stopping
(first-arrival) times at absorbing states, signifying completion of tasks. We
show when the prior law on paths is Markov, a Markov policy is once again
optimal to satisfy those marginal constraints with respect to a likelihood cost
following Schr\"odinger's dictum. Based on this, we present the mathematical
formulation involving a Sinkhorn-type iteration to construct the optimal
probability law on paths matching the spatio-temporal marginals.

                                        <span>  Combinatorial bilevel congestion pricing (CBCP), a variant of the discrete
network design problem, seeks to minimize the total travel time experienced by
all travelers in a road network, by strategically selecting toll locations and
determining the corresponding charges. Conventional wisdom suggests that these
problems are intractable since they have to be formulated and solved with a
significant number of integer variables. Here, we devise a scalable local
algorithm for the CBCP problem that guarantees convergence to a
Kuhn-Tucker-Karush point. Our approach is novel in that it eliminates the use
of integer variables altogether, instead introducing a cardinality constraint
that limits the number of toll locations to a user-specified upper bound. The
resulting bilevel program with the cardinality constraint is then transformed
into a block-separable, single-level optimization problem that can be solved
efficiently after penalization and decomposition. We are able to apply the
algorithm to solve, in about 20 minutes, a CBCP instance with up to 3,000
links, of which hundreds can be tolled. To the best of our knowledge, no
existing algorithm can solve CBCP problems at such a scale while providing any
assurance of convergence.

management and resource allocation. State-of-the-art OLP algorithms achieve low
regret by repeatedly solving linear programming (LP) subproblems that
incorporate updated resource information. However, LP-based methods are
computationally expensive and often inefficient for large-scale applications.
In contrast, recent first-order OLP algorithms are more computationally
efficient but typically suffer from worse regret guarantees. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a new algorithm that combines the strengths of
LP-based and first-order OLP methods. The algorithm re-solves the LP
subproblems periodically at a predefined frequency $f$ and uses the latest dual
prices to guide online decision-making. In addition, a first-order method runs
in parallel during each interval between LP re-solves, smoothing resource
consumption. Our algorithm achieves $\mathscr{O}(\log (T/f) + \sqrt{f})$
regret, delivering a "wait-less" online decision-making process that balances
the computational efficiency of first-order methods and the superior regret
guarantee of LP-based methods.

undirected graphs. The optimization problem consists of minimizing a nonconvex
smooth function plus a convex extended-value function, which enforces
constraints or extra structure on the solution (e.g., sparsity, low-rank). We
further assume that the objective function satisfies the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz
(KL) property, with given exponent $\theta\in [0,1)$. The KL property is
satisfied by several (nonconvex) functions of practical interest, e.g., arising
from machine learning applications; in the centralized setting, it permits to
achieve strong convergence guarantees. Here we establish convergence of the
same type for the notorious decentralized gradient-tracking-based algorithm
SONATA. Specifically, $\textbf{(i)}$ when $\theta\in (0,1/2]$, the sequence
generated by SONATA converges to a stationary solution of the problem at
R-linear rate;$ \textbf{(ii)} $when $\theta\in (1/2,1)$, sublinear rate is
certified; and finally $\textbf{(iii)}$ when $\theta=0$, the iterates will
either converge in a finite number of steps or converges at R-linear rate. This
matches the convergence behavior of centralized proximal-gradient algorithms
except when $\theta=0$. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings.

theoretical) preference optimization methods suffer from both types of reward
hacking. To mitigate Type I Reward Hacking, we propose POWER, a new preference
optimization method that combines Guiasu's weighted entropy with a robust
reward maximization objective. POWER enjoys finite-sample guarantees under
general function approximation, competing with the best covered policy in the
data. To mitigate Type II Reward Hacking, we analyze the learning dynamics of
preference optimization and develop a novel technique that dynamically updates
preference labels toward certain "stationary labels", resulting in diminishing
gradients for untrustworthy samples. Empirically, POWER with dynamic labels
(POWER-DL) consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on alignment
benchmarks, achieving improvements of up to 13.0 points on AlpacaEval 2.0 and
11.5 points on Arena-Hard over DPO, while also improving or maintaining
performance on downstream tasks such as mathematical reasoning. Strong
theoretical guarantees and empirical results demonstrate the promise of
POWER-DL in mitigating reward hacking.

                                        <span>  Gradient descent is one of the most widely used iterative algorithms in
modern statistical learning. However, its precise algorithmic dynamics in
high-dimensional settings remain only partially understood, which has therefore
limited its broader potential for statistical inference applications.
  This paper provides a precise, non-asymptotic distributional characterization
of gradient descent iterates in a broad class of empirical risk minimization
problems, in the so-called mean-field regime where the sample size is
proportional to the signal dimension. Our non-asymptotic state evolution theory
holds for both general non-convex loss functions and non-Gaussian data, and
reveals the central role of two Onsager correction matrices that precisely
characterize the non-trivial dependence among all gradient descent iterates in
the mean-field regime.
  Although the Onsager correction matrices are typically analytically
intractable, our state evolution theory facilitates a generic gradient descent
inference algorithm that consistently estimates these matrices across a broad
class of models. Leveraging this algorithm, we show that the state evolution
can be inverted to construct (i) data-driven estimators for the generalization
error of gradient descent iterates and (ii) debiased gradient descent iterates
for inference of the unknown signal. Detailed applications to two canonical
models--linear regression and (generalized) logistic regression--are worked out
to illustrate model-specific features of our general theory and inference
methods.

                                        <span>  A review of scientific papers has shown that digital twins are very common
for modeling the states of physical objects. It is relevant to consider the
creation of a digital twin of an enterprise to obtain various assessments in
management, taking into account the human factor. In the research, the impact
of the human factor is assessed by the digital twin and staff competencies. The
system of goals of staff competencies stands for: cognitive, affective,
psychomotor. An enterprise model is created from the description of the set of
events taking place on it. Each event is mapped to an element of staff
competencies target system. The resulting set of staff competencies is
estimated by a universal (integral) indicator. The dynamics of the universal
indicator characterizes two modes of operation of the enterprise. The first
operating mode is normal. The second mode of operation is based on the
implementation of staff competencies. Taking into account the competencies of
personnel by Bloom's taxonomy allows you to determine their interconnection:
cognitive, affective, psychomotor. It correlation depends on the work performed
by the employee and the influence of the external environment. It depends on
the efforts of the employee as a learner.

policy and a receiver, upon observing a realization of this policy, decides
whether to take a particular action, such as making a purchase. The sender's
objective is to maximize her utility derived from the receiver's action, and
she achieves this by careful selection of the information policy. Building on
the work of Kleiner et al., our focus lies specifically on information policies
that are associated with power diagram partitions of the underlying domain. To
address this problem, we employ entropy-regularized optimal transport, which
enables us to develop an efficient algorithm for finding the optimal solution.
We present experimental numerical results that highlight the qualitative
properties of the optimal configurations, providing valuable insights into
their structure. Furthermore, we extend our numerical investigation to derive
optimal information policies for monopolists dealing with multiple products,
where the sender discloses information about product qualities.

of fuel delivery to gas stations. The CVRP aims to minimize total travel
distance for a fleet with limited capacity. Fuel delivery, however, introduces
unique complexities within the CVRP framework. We propose a novel approach that
integrates the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm with a customized CVRP model
specifically designed for gas station networks. This model incorporates
real-world constraints like vehicle capacity, fuel demands at each station, and
road network distances. The paper outlines the design of SA-based CVRP model
for fuel delivery. We detail the objective function (minimizing distance) and
the SA's exploration mechanism for generating candidate solutions. To assess
its effectiveness, the proposed approach undergoes computational tests in
Poland's gas station network serviced by the Samat transportation company. We
compare the performance of our SA-based CVRP model with the conventional Mixed
Integer Programming model for CVRP powered by Gurobi. The results aim to
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SA-based heuristic in finding
efficient routes for fuel deliveries.

in both scientific and technological domains, within academic research and
industrial applications. A considerable amount of effort has been invested in
the development of accelerated methods that leverage sophisticated models and
harness the power of advanced computational hardware. Despite the advancements,
a critical challenge persists, the dual demand for both high efficiency and
broad generality in solving problems. In this work, we propose a general
method, Free-Energy Machine (FEM), based on the ideas of free-energy
minimization in statistical physics, combined with automatic differentiation
and gradient-based optimization in machine learning. The algorithm is flexible,
solving various combinatorial optimization problems using a unified framework,
and is efficient, naturally utilizing massive parallel computational devices
such as graph processing units (GPUs) and field-programmable gate arrays
(FPGAs). We benchmark our algorithm on various problems including the maximum
cut problems, balanced minimum cut problems, and maximum $k$-satisfiability
problems, scaled to millions of variables, across both synthetic, real-world,
and competition problem instances. The findings indicate that our algorithm not
only exhibits exceptional speed but also surpasses the performance of
state-of-the-art algorithms tailored for individual problems. This highlights
that the interdisciplinary fusion of statistical physics and machine learning
opens the door to delivering cutting-edge methodologies that will have broad
implications across various scientific and industrial landscapes.

the framework of entropic optimal transport. We show entropic stability for
optimal plans in terms of the Wasserstein distance between their marginals
under a semiconcavity assumption on the sum of the cost and one of the two
entropic potentials. When employed in the analysis of Sinkhorn's algorithm,
this result gives a natural sufficient condition for its exponential
convergence, which does not require the ground cost to be bounded. By
controlling from above the Hessians of Sinkhorn potentials in examples of
interest, we obtain new exponential convergence results. For instance, for the
first time we obtain exponential convergence for log-concave marginals and
quadratic costs for all values of the regularization parameter. Moreover, the
convergence rate has a linear dependence on the regularization: this behavior
is sharp and had only been previously obtained for compact distributions
arXiv:2407.01202. Other interesting new applications include subspace elastic
costs [Cuturi et al. PMLR 202(2023)], weakly log-concave marginals, marginals
with light tails, where, under reinforced assumptions, we manage to improve the
rates obtained in arXiv:2311.04041, the case of unbounded Lipschitz costs, and
compact Riemannian manifolds.

                                        <span>  Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a state-of-the-art global optimisation
technique for black-box problems where derivative information is unavailable,
and sample efficiency is crucial. However, improving the general scalability of
BO has proved challenging. Here, we explore Latent Space Bayesian Optimisation
(LSBO), that applies dimensionality reduction to perform BO in a
reduced-dimensional subspace. While early LSBO methods used (linear) random
projections (Wang et al., 2013), we employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to
manage more complex data structures and general DR tasks. Building on Grosnit
et. al. (2021), we analyse the VAE-based LSBO framework, focusing on VAE
retraining and deep metric loss. We suggest a few key corrections in their
implementation, originally designed for tasks such as molecule generation, and
reformulate the algorithm for broader optimisation purposes. Our numerical
results show that structured latent manifolds improve BO performance.
Additionally, we examine the use of the Mat\'{e}rn-$\frac{5}{2}$ kernel for
Gaussian Processes in this LSBO context. We also integrate Sequential Domain
Reduction (SDR), a standard global optimization efficiency strategy, into BO.
SDR is included in a GPU-based environment using \textit{BoTorch}, both in the
original and VAE-generated latent spaces, marking the first application of SDR
within LSBO.

formulation of mean field games (MFG) for modeling liquidity pools in a
constant product automated market maker (AMM) protocol in the context of
decentralized finance. Our work extends one of the most conventional
applications of MFG, which is the price impact model in an order book, by
incorporating an AMM instead of a traditional order book. Through our approach,
we achieve results that support the existence of solutions to the Mean Field
Game and, additionally, the existence of approximate Nash equilibria for the
proposed problem. These results not only offer a new perspective for
representing liquidity pools in AMMs but also open promising opportunities for
future research in this emerging field.

evaluation of the absolute value. The linear independence kink qualification
(LIKQ) is a fundamental assumption in optimization problems governed by these
abs-smooth functions, generalizing the well-known LICQ from smooth
optimization. In particular, provided that LIKQ holds it is possible to derive
optimality conditions for abs-smooth optimization problems that can be checked
in polynomial time. Utilizing tools from differential topology, namely a
version of the jet-transversality theorem, it is shown that assuming LIKQ for
all feasible points of an abs-smooth optimization problem is a generic
assumption.

                                        <span>  This paper studies the robust reinsurance and investment games for
competitive insurers. Model uncertainty is characterized by a class of
equivalent probability measures. Each insurer is concerned with relative
performance under the worst-case scenario. Insurers' surplus processes are
approximated by drifted Brownian motion with common and idiosyncratic insurance
risks. The insurers can purchase proportional reinsurance to divide the
insurance risk with the reinsurance premium calculated by the variance
principle. We consider an incomplete market driven by the 4/2 stochastic
volatility mode. This paper formulates the robust mean-field game for a
non-linear system originating from the variance principle and the 4/2 model.
For the case of an exponential utility function, we derive closed-form
solutions for the $n$-insurer game and the corresponding mean-field game. We
show that relative concerns lead to new hedging terms in the investment and
reinsurance strategies. Model uncertainty can significantly change the
insurers' hedging demands. The hedging demands in the investment-reinsurance
strategies exhibit highly non-linear dependence with the insurers' competitive
coefficients, risk aversion and ambiguity aversion coefficients. Finally,
numerical results demonstrate the herd effect of competition.

                                        <span>  Machine unlearning, the process of selectively removing data from trained
models, is increasingly crucial for addressing privacy concerns and knowledge
gaps post-deployment. Despite this importance, existing approaches are often
heuristic and lack formal guarantees. In this paper, we analyze the fundamental
utility, time, and space complexity trade-offs of approximate unlearning,
providing rigorous certification analogous to differential privacy. For
in-distribution forget data -- data similar to the retain set -- we show that a
surprisingly simple and general procedure, empirical risk minimization with
output perturbation, achieves tight unlearning-utility-complexity trade-offs,
addressing a previous theoretical gap on the separation from unlearning "for
free" via differential privacy, which inherently facilitates the removal of
such data. However, such techniques fail with out-of-distribution forget data
-- data significantly different from the retain set -- where unlearning time
complexity can exceed that of retraining, even for a single sample. To address
this, we propose a new robust and noisy gradient descent variant that provably
amortizes unlearning time complexity without compromising utility.

speed and charging planning designed for connected electric vehicles (EVs).
With EVs emerging as competitive alternatives to internal combustion engine
vehicles, overcoming challenges such as limited charging infrastructure is
crucial. evS2CP addresses these issues by minimizing the travel time, charging
time, and energy consumption, providing practical solutions for both
human-operated and autonomous vehicles. This framework leverages V2X
communication to integrate essential EV planning data, including route
geometry, real-time traffic conditions, and charging station availability,
while simulating dynamic driving environments using open-web API services. The
speed and charging planning problem was initially formulated as a nonlinear
programming model, which was then convexified into a quadratic programming
model without charging-stop constraints. Additionally, a mixed-integer
programming approach was employed to optimize charging station selection and
minimize the frequency of charging events. A mixed-integer quadratic
programming implementation exhibited exceptional computational efficiency and
scalability, effectively solving trip plans over distances exceeding 700 km in
a few seconds. Simulations conducted using open-source and commercial solvers
validated the framework's near-global optimality, demonstrating its robustness
and feasibility for real-world applications in connected EV ecosystems.

                                        <span>  Mixed service mode docks enhance efficiency by flexibly handling both loading
and unloading trucks in warehouses. However, existing research often
predetermines the number and location of these docks prior to planning truck
assignment and sequencing. This paper proposes a new model integrating dock
mode decision, truck assignment, and scheduling, thus enabling adaptive dock
mode arrangements. Specifically, we introduce a Q-learning-based adaptive large
neighborhood search (Q-ALNS) algorithm to address the integrated problem. The
algorithm adjusts dock modes via perturbation operators, while truck assignment
and scheduling are solved using destroy and repair local search operators.
Q-learning adaptively selects these operators based on their performance
history and future gains, employing the epsilon-greedy strategy. Extensive
experimental results and statistical analysis indicate that the Q-ALNS benefits
from efficient operator combinations and its adaptive mechanism, consistently
outperforming benchmark algorithms in terms of optimality gap and Pareto front
discovery. In comparison to the predetermined service mode, our adaptive
strategy results in lower average tardiness and makespan, highlighting its
superior adaptability to varying demands.

Dynkin (stopping) game. We present a complete equilibrium solution to a general
formulation of this game with an underlying one-dimensional diffusion. A key
result is the construction of a characterizable global $\epsilon$-Nash
equilibrium in Markovian randomized stopping times for every $\epsilon > 0$.
This is achieved by leveraging the well-known equilibrium structure under a
restrictive ordering condition on the payoff functions, leading to a novel
approach based on an appropriate notion of randomization that allows for
solving the general game without any ordering condition. Additionally, we
provide conditions for the existence of pure and randomized Nash equilibria
(with $\epsilon=0$). Our results enable explicit identification of equilibrium
stopping times and their corresponding values in many cases, illustrated by
several examples.

programming. The Augmented Lagrangian Method, one of the most famous
optimization algorithms, has been found to be closely related to the proximal
point algorithm. Due to its importance, accelerated variants of the proximal
point algorithm have received considerable attention. In this paper, we first
study an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) system, which provides valuable
insights into proving the convergence rate of the desired algorithm. Using the
Lyapunov function technique, we establish the convergence rate of the ODE
system. Next, we apply the Symplectic Euler Method to discretize the ODE system
to derive a new proximal point algorithm, called the Symplectic Proximal Point
Algorithm (SPPA). By utilizing the proof techniques developed for the ODE
system, we demonstrate the convergence rate of the SPPA. Additionally, it is
shown that existing accelerated proximal point algorithm can be considered a
special case of the SPPA in a specific manner. Furthermore, under several
additional assumptions, we prove that the SPPA exhibits a finer convergence
rate.

subspaces defined by linear dynamical systems, leveraging optimization on the
Grassmannian manifold leading to the Grassmannian Recursive Algorithm for
Tracking (GREAT) method. The approach of representing linear systems by
non-parametric subspace models has received significant interest in the field
of data-driven control recently. We view subspaces as points on the
Grassmannian manifold, and therefore, tracking is achieved by performing
optimization on the manifold. At each time step, a single measurement from the
current subspace corrupted by a bounded error is available. The subspace
estimate is updated online using Grassmannian gradient descent on a cost
function incorporating a window of the most recent data. Under suitable
assumptions on the signal-to-noise ratio of the online data and the subspace's
rate of change, we establish theoretical guarantees for the resulting
algorithm. More specifically, we prove an exponential convergence rate and
provide a consistent uncertainty quantification of the estimates in terms of an
upper bound on their distance to the true subspace. The applicability of the
proposed algorithm is demonstrated by means of numerical examples, and it is
shown to compare favorably with competing parametric system identification
methods.

Stackelberg game with $H_\infty$ constraint. Based on $H_2/H_\infty$ control
theory, we firstly obtain the worst-case disturbance and the team-optimal
strategy by dealing with a nonzero-sum stochastic differential game. The main
objective is to establish an incentive Stackelberg strategy set of the
three-level hierarchy in which the whole system achieves the top leader's
team-optimal solution and attenuates the external disturbance under $H_\infty$
constraint. On the other hand, followers on the bottom two levels in turn
attain their state feedback Nash equilibrium, ensuring incentive Stackelberg
strategies while considering the worst-case disturbance. By convex analysis
theory, maximum principle and decoupling technique, the three-level incentive
Stackelberg strategy set is obtained. Finally, a numerical example is given to
illustrate the existence of the proposed strategy set.

                                        <span>  Probabilistic prediction of stochastic dynamical systems (SDSs) aims to
accurately predict the conditional probability distributions of future states.
However, accurate probabilistic predictions tightly hinge on accurate
distributional information from a nominal model, which is hardly available in
practice. To address this issue, we propose a novel functional-maximin-based
distributionally robust probabilistic prediction (DRPP) framework. In this
framework, one can design probabilistic predictors that have worst-case
performance guarantees over a pre-defined ambiguity set of SDSs. Nevertheless,
DRPP requires optimizing over the function space of probability distributions,
which is generally intractable. We develop a methodology that equivalently
transforms the original maximin in function spaces into convex-nonconcave
minimax in Euclidean spaces. Although it remains intractable to seek a global
optimal solution, two suboptimal solutions are derived. By relaxing the inner
constraints, we obtain a suboptimal predictor called Noise-DRPP. Relaxing the
outer constraints yields another suboptimal predictor, Eig-DRPP. More
importantly, we establish an explicit upper bound on the optimality gap between
Eig-DRPP and the global optimal predictor. Utilizing the theoretical results
obtained from solving the two suboptimal predictors, we synthesize practical
rules to judge whether the pre-defined ambiguity set is too large or small.
Finally, we conduct elaborate numerical simulations to compare the performance
of different predictors under different SDSs.

pertubations affecting both the concentrations and the kinetic parameters.
Structural dynamical robustness has been proposed as a defining feature of such
networks. In this paper, we propose the notion of structural contractivity. We
build on the previous work of the authors which characterized the long-term
dynamics of classes of Biological Interaction Networks (BINs), based on
"rate-dependent Lyapunov functions". Here, we show that stronger notions of
convergence can be established by proving structural contractivity with respect
to non-standard polyhederal $\ell_\infty$-norms. In particular, we show that
such networks are non-expansive. With additional verifiable conditions, we show
that they are strictly contractive over arbitrary positive compact sets. In
addition, we show that such networks entrain to periodic inputs. We illustrate
our theory with examples from signaling pathways.

                                        <span>  We examine the last-iterate convergence rate of Bregman proximal methods -
from mirror descent to mirror-prox and its optimistic variants - as a function
of the local geometry induced by the prox-mapping defining the method. For
generality, we focus on local solutions of constrained, non-monotone
variational inequalities, and we show that the convergence rate of a given
method depends sharply on its associated Legendre exponent, a notion that
measures the growth rate of the underlying Bregman function (Euclidean,
entropic, or other) near a solution. In particular, we show that boundary
solutions exhibit a stark separation of regimes between methods with a zero and
non-zero Legendre exponent: the former converge at a linear rate, while the
latter converge, in general, sublinearly. This dichotomy becomes even more
pronounced in linearly constrained problems where methods with entropic
regularization achieve a linear convergence rate along sharp directions,
compared to convergence in a finite number of steps under Euclidean
regularization.

                                        <span>  We present a rigorous convergence analysis of a new method for density-based
topology optimization: Sigmoidal Mirror descent with a Projected Latent
variable. SiMPL, pronounced like "simple," provides point-wise bound preserving
design updates and faster convergence than other popular first-order topology
optimization methods. Due to its strong bound preservation, the method is
exceptionally robust, as demonstrated in numerous examples here and in the
companion article. Furthermore, it is easy to implement with clear structure
and analytical expressions for the updates. Our analysis covers two versions of
the method, characterized by the employed line search strategies. We consider a
modified Armijo backtracking line search and a Bregman backtracking line
search. For both line search algorithms, SiMPL delivers a strict monotone
decrease in the objective function and further intuitive convergence
properties, e.g., strong and pointwise convergence of the density variables on
the active sets, norm convergence to zero of the increments, convergence of the
Lagrange multipliers, and more. In addition, the numerical experiments
demonstrate apparent mesh-independent convergence of the algorithm.

1999. It causes a lot of controversy and approval from different sides. For the
sake of clarity, an assessment is being made of the industrial application of
the Dublin Descriptors. The assessment is based on the method of integral
indicators. To use the method, the enterprise is formalized as a model of
events at each moment in time. Each event in the enterprise is tied to the
student's skill. Accordingly, students' skills are grouped by educational
level. Education levels are given as Dublin descriptors. The chosen approach
makes it possible to determine the correlation between levels of education and
skills. It makes it possible to analyze meaningful interconnection. A universal
assessment of the use of Dublin descriptors in the enterprise allows the
formation of up-to-date lists of employees for higher education, professional
development and training.

                                        <span>  Most existing necessary conditions for optimal control based on adjoining
methods require both state and costate information, yet the unobservability of
costates for a given feasible trajectory impedes the determination of
optimality in practice. This paper establishes a novel theoretical framework
for time-optimal control of controllable linear systems with a single input,
proposing the augmented switching law (ASL) that represents the input control
and the feasibility in a compact form. Given a feasible trajectory, the
perturbed trajectory under the constraints of ASL is guaranteed to be feasible,
resulting in a novel state-centric necessary condition without dependence on
costate information. A first-order necessary condition is proposed that the
Jacobian matrix of the ASL is not full row rank, which also results in a
potential approach to optimizing a given feasible trajectory with the
preservation of arc structures. The proposed necessary condition is applied to
high-order chain-of-integrator systems with full box constraints, contributing
to some theoretical results challenging to reason by costate-based conditions.

                                        <span>  In the real world, a learning-enabled system usually undergoes multiple
cycles of model development to enhance the system's ability to handle difficult
or emerging tasks. This continual model development process raises a
significant issue that the model development for acquiring new or improving
existing capabilities may inadvertently lose capabilities of the old model,
also known as catastrophic forgetting. Existing continual learning studies
focus on mitigating catastrophic forgetting by trading off performance on
previous tasks and new tasks to ensure good average performance. However, they
are inadequate for many applications especially in safety-critical domains, as
failure to strictly preserve the good performance of the old model not only
introduces safety risks and uncertainties but also imposes substantial expenses
in the re-improving and re-validation of existing properties. To address this
issue, we introduce model developmental safety as a guarantee of a learning
system such that in the model development process the new model should strictly
preserve the existing protected capabilities of the old model while improving
its performance on target tasks. To ensure the model developmental safety, we
present a retention-centric framework by formulating the model developmental
safety as data-dependent constraints. Under this framework, we study how to
develop a pretrained vision-language model, specifically the CLIP model, for
acquiring new capabilities or improving existing capabilities of image
classification. We propose an efficient constrained optimization algorithm with
theoretical guarantee and use its insights to finetune a CLIP model with
task-dependent heads for promoting the model developmental safety. Our
experiments on improving vision perception capabilities on autonomous driving
and scene recognition datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
approach.

agents to collaboratively train Machine Learning (ML) models in a distributed
manner, eliminating the need for sharing their local data. The recent work
(arXiv:2106.02969) introduces a family of Federated Newton Learn (FedNL)
algorithms, marking a significant step towards applying second-order methods to
FL and large-scale optimization. However, the reference FedNL prototype
exhibits three serious practical drawbacks: (i) It requires 4.8 hours to launch
a single experiment in a sever-grade workstation; (ii) The prototype only
simulates multi-node setting; (iii) Prototype integration into
resource-constrained applications is challenging. To bridge the gap between
theory and practice, we present a self-contained implementation of FedNL,
FedNL-LS, FedNL-PP for single-node and multi-node settings. Our work resolves
the aforementioned issues and reduces the wall clock time by x1000. With this
FedNL outperforms alternatives for training logistic regression in a
single-node -- CVXPY (arXiv:1603.00943), and in a multi-node -- Apache Spark
(arXiv:1505.06807), Ray/Scikit-Learn (arXiv:1712.05889). Finally, we propose
two practical-orientated compressors for FedNL - adaptive TopLEK and
cache-aware RandSeqK, which fulfill the theory of FedNL.

                                        <span>  This paper is concerned with a unified treatment of linear quadratic control
problem for stochastic Volterra integral equations (SVIEs), motivated by the
various approaches and scattered results in the existing literature. A novel
class of optimal causal feedback strategy is introduced and characterized by
means of a new Riccati system. To this end, a fundamental function space and an
appropriate multiplicative rule among functions are defined for the first time.
In contrast with the existing works, our unified treatment not only provides a
new approach, but also extends or improves the known conclusions in stochastic
differential equations, convolution SVIEs, stochastic Volterra
integro-differential equations (VIDEs), deterministic VIEs, deterministic
VIDEs. In addition, an interesting phenomenon is reveal by the current study:
for SVIEs the conventional structure of state feedback is replaced by a
suitable causal form, and the original state process no longer plays
indispensable role in the feedbacks while an auxiliary state process does.

minimizing a twice differentiable objective function with H\"older continuous
Hessian. Specifically, we first propose a Newton-conjugate gradient (Newton-CG)
method for finding an approximate first- and second-order stationary point of
this problem, assuming the associated the H\"older parameters are explicitly
known. Then we develop a parameter-free Newton-CG method without requiring any
prior knowledge of these parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this method
is the first parameter-free second-order method achieving the best-known
iteration and operation complexity for finding an approximate first- and
second-order stationary point of this problem. Finally, we present preliminary
numerical results to demonstrate the superior practical performance of our
parameter-free Newton-CG method over a well-known regularized Newton method.

optimization problems, which encompass most existing nonconvex
sparsity-inducing terms. We show the second-order optimality conditions only
depend on the nonzeros of the stationary points. We propose two damped
iterative reweighted algorithms including the iteratively reweighted $\ell_1$
algorithm (DIRL$_1$) and the iteratively reweighted $\ell_2$ (DIRL$_2$)
algorithm, to solve these problems. For DIRL$_1$, we show the reweighted
$\ell_1$ subproblem has support identification property so that DIRL$_1$
locally reverts to a gradient descent algorithm around a stationary point. For
DIRL$_2$, we show the solution map of the reweighted $\ell_2$ subproblem is
differentiable and Lipschitz continuous everywhere. Therefore, the map of
DIRL$_1$ and DIRL$_2$ and their inverse are Lipschitz continuous, and the
strict saddle points are their unstable fixed points. By applying the stable
manifold theorem, these algorithms are shown to converge only to local
minimizers with randomly initialization when the strictly saddle point property
is assumed.

                                        <span>  With the rapid growth of data volume and the increasing demand for real-time
analysis, online subspace clustering has emerged as an effective tool for
processing dynamic data streams. However, existing online subspace clustering
methods often struggle to capture the complex and evolving distribution of such
data due to their reliance on rigid dictionary learning mechanisms. In this
paper, we propose a novel $\ell_0$ elastic net subspace clustering model by
integrating the $\ell_0$ norm and the Frobenius norm, which owns the desirable
block diagonal property. To address the challenges posed by the evolving data
distributions in online data, we design a fast online alternating direction
method of multipliers with an innovative dictionary update strategy based on
support points, which are a set of data points to capture the underlying
distribution of the data. By selectively updating dictionary atoms according to
the support points, the proposed method can dynamically adapt to the evolving
data characteristics, thereby enhancing both adaptability and computational
efficiency. Moreover, we rigorously prove the convergence of the algorithm.
Finally, extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
improves clustering performance and computational efficiency, making it
well-suited for real-time and large-scale data processing tasks.

construction for a sterile insect technique model. The Sterile Insect Technique
(SIT) is one of the most ecological methods for controlling insect pests
responsible for worldwide crop destruction and disease transmission. In this
work, we construct a feedback law that globally asymptotically stabilizes a SIT
model at extinction equilibrium. Since the application of this type of control
requires the measurement of different states of the target insect population,
and in practice, some states are more difficult and very expensive to measure
than others, it is important to know how to construct a state estimator which
from a few measured states, estimates the other ones as the one we build in the
second part of our work. In the last part of our work, we show that we can
apply the feedback control with estimated states to stabilize the full system.

                                        <span>  The classical Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality theorem establishes a
significant connection between Monge optimal transport and maximization of a
linear form on the set of 1-Lipschitz functions. This result has been widely
used in various research areas. In particular, it unlocks the optimal transport
methods in some of the optimal design problems. This paper puts forth a similar
theory when the linear form is maximized over $C^{1,1}$ functions whose Hessian
lies between minus and plus identity matrix. The problem will be identified as
the dual of a specific optimal transport formulation that involves three-point
plans. The first two marginals are fixed, while the third must dominate the
other two in the sense of convex order. The existence of optimal plans allows
to express solutions of the underlying Beckmann problem as a combination of
rank-one tensor measures supported on a graph. In the context of
two-dimensional mechanics, this graph encodes the optimal configuration of a
grillage that transfers a given load system.

from a angle $\beta$ of the triangle corresponding to the side whose length is
$\Vert \mathbf{x} \Vert_{\infty} - \Vert \mathbf{x} \Vert_{1}/\Vert \mathbf{x}

                                        <span>  This paper considers finitely many investors who perform mean-variance
portfolio selection under relative performance criteria. That is, each investor
is concerned about not only her terminal wealth, but how it compares to the
average terminal wealth of all investors. At the inter-personal level, each
investor selects a trading strategy in response to others' strategies. This
selected strategy additionally needs to yield an equilibrium intra-personally,
so as to resolve time inconsistency among the investor's current and future
selves (triggered by the mean-variance objective). A Nash equilibrium we look
for is thus a tuple of trading strategies under which every investor achieves
her intra-personal equilibrium simultaneously. We derive such a Nash
equilibrium explicitly in the idealized case of full information (i.e., the
dynamics of the underlying stock is perfectly known) and semi-explicitly in the
realistic case of partial information (i.e., the stock evolution is observed,
but the expected return of the stock is not precisely known). The formula under
partial information consists of the myopic trading and intertemporal hedging
terms, both of which depend on an additional state process that serves to
filter the true expected return and whose influence on trading is captured by a
degenerate Cauchy problem. Our results identify that relative performance
criteria can induce downward self-reinforcement of investors' wealth--if every
investor suffers a wealth decline simultaneously, then everyone's wealth tends
to decline further. This phenomenon, as numerical examples show, is negligible
under full information but pronounced under partial information.

                                        <span>  In online convex optimization, some efficient algorithms have been designed
for each of the individual classes of objective functions, e.g., convex,
strongly convex, and exp-concave. However, existing regret analyses, including
those of universal algorithms, are limited to cases in which the objective
functions in all rounds belong to the same class and cannot be applied to cases
in which the property of objective functions may change in each time step. This
paper introduces a novel approach to address such cases, proposing a new regime
we term as \textit{contaminated} online convex optimization. For the
contaminated case, we demonstrate that the regret is lower bounded by
$\Omega(\log T + \sqrt{k})$. Here, $k$ signifies the level of contamination in
the objective functions. We also demonstrate that the regret is bounded by
$O(\log T+\sqrt{k\log T})$ when universal algorithms are used. When our
proposed algorithms with additional information are employed, the regret is
bounded by $O(\log T+\sqrt{k})$, which matches the lower bound. These are
intermediate bounds between a convex case and a strongly convex or exp-concave
case.

                                        <span>  The problem of reconciling a prior probability law on paths with data was
introduced by E. Schr\"odinger in 1931/32. It represents an early formulation
of a maximum likelihood problem. This specific formulation can also be seen as
the control problem to modify the law of a diffusion process so as to match
specifications on marginal distributions at given times. Thereby, in recent
years, this so-called Schr\"odinger's bridge problem has been at the center of
the uncertainty control development. However, an understudied facet of this
program has been to address uncertainty in space (state) and time, modeling the
effect of tasks being completed contingent on meeting a certain condition at
some random time instead of imposing specifications at fixed times. The present
work is a study to extend Schr\"odinger's paradigm on such an issue, and
herein, it is tackled in the context of random walks on directed graphs.
Specifically, we study the case where one marginal is the initial probability
distribution on a Markov chain, while others are marginals of stopping
(first-arrival) times at absorbing states, signifying completion of tasks. We
show when the prior law on paths is Markov, a Markov policy is once again
optimal to satisfy those marginal constraints with respect to a likelihood cost
following Schr\"odinger's dictum. Based on this, we present the mathematical
formulation involving a Sinkhorn-type iteration to construct the optimal
probability law on paths matching the spatio-temporal marginals.

                                        <span>  Combinatorial bilevel congestion pricing (CBCP), a variant of the discrete
network design problem, seeks to minimize the total travel time experienced by
all travelers in a road network, by strategically selecting toll locations and
determining the corresponding charges. Conventional wisdom suggests that these
problems are intractable since they have to be formulated and solved with a
significant number of integer variables. Here, we devise a scalable local
algorithm for the CBCP problem that guarantees convergence to a
Kuhn-Tucker-Karush point. Our approach is novel in that it eliminates the use
of integer variables altogether, instead introducing a cardinality constraint
that limits the number of toll locations to a user-specified upper bound. The
resulting bilevel program with the cardinality constraint is then transformed
into a block-separable, single-level optimization problem that can be solved
efficiently after penalization and decomposition. We are able to apply the
algorithm to solve, in about 20 minutes, a CBCP instance with up to 3,000
links, of which hundreds can be tolled. To the best of our knowledge, no
existing algorithm can solve CBCP problems at such a scale while providing any
assurance of convergence.

                                        <span>  Navigating unmanned aerial vehicles in environments where GPS signals are
unavailable poses a compelling and intricate challenge. This challenge is
further heightened when dealing with Nano Aerial Vehicles (NAVs) due to their
compact size, payload restrictions, and computational capabilities. This paper
proposes an approach for localization using off-board computing, an off-board
monocular camera, and modified open-source algorithms. The proposed method uses
three parallel proportional-integral-derivative controllers on the off-board
computer to provide velocity corrections via wireless communication,
stabilizing the NAV in a custom-controlled environment. Featuring a 3.1cm
localization error and a modest setup cost of 50 USD, this approach proves
optimal for environments where cost considerations are paramount. It is
especially well-suited for applications like teaching drone control in academic
institutions, where the specified error margin is deemed acceptable. Various
applications are designed to validate the proposed technique, such as landing
the NAV on a moving ground vehicle, path planning in a 3D space, and localizing
multi-NAVs. The created package is openly available at
https://github.com/simmubhangu/eyantra_drone to foster research in this field.

                                        <span>  Modeling the evolutions of driving scenarios is important for the evaluation
and decision-making of autonomous driving systems. Most existing methods focus
on one aspect of scene evolution such as map generation, motion prediction, and
trajectory planning. In this paper, we propose a unified Generative
Pre-training for Driving (GPD-1) model to accomplish all these tasks altogether
without additional fine-tuning. We represent each scene with ego, agent, and
map tokens and formulate autonomous driving as a unified token generation
problem. We adopt the autoregressive transformer architecture and use a
scene-level attention mask to enable intra-scene bi-directional interactions.
For the ego and agent tokens, we propose a hierarchical positional tokenizer to
effectively encode both 2D positions and headings. For the map tokens, we train
a map vector-quantized autoencoder to efficiently compress ego-centric semantic
maps into discrete tokens. We pre-train our GPD-1 on the large-scale nuPlan
dataset and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its effectiveness. With
different prompts, our GPD-1 successfully generalizes to various tasks without
finetuning, including scene generation, traffic simulation, closed-loop
simulation, map prediction, and motion planning. Code:

                                        <span>  Multi-robot collaborative transportation is a critical capability that has
attracted significant attention over recent years. To reliably transport a
kinematically constrained payload, a team of robots must closely collaborate
and coordinate their individual velocities to achieve the desired payload
motion. For quadruped robots, a key challenge is caused by their anisotropic
velocity limits, where forward and backward movement is faster and more stable
than lateral motion. In order to enable dual-quadruped collaborative
transportation and address the above challenges, we propose a novel Bilevel
Learning for Collaborative Transportation (BLCT) approach. In the upper-level,
BLCT learns a team collaboration policy for the two quadruped robots to move
the payload to the goal position, while accounting for the kinematic
constraints imposed by their connection to the payload. In the lower-level,
BLCT optimizes velocity controls of each individual robot to closely follow the
collaboration policy while satisfying the anisotropic velocity constraints and
avoiding obstacles. Experiments demonstrate that our BLCT approach well enables
collaborative transportation in challenging scenarios and outperforms baseline
approaches.

scale of training data, primarily constrained by the manual curation of
existing simulators. To address this, we introduce RoomTour3D, a
video-instruction dataset derived from web-based room tour videos that capture
real-world indoor spaces and human walking demonstrations. Unlike existing VLN
datasets, RoomTour3D leverages the scale and diversity of online videos to
generate open-ended human walking trajectories and open-world navigable
instructions. To compensate for the lack of navigation data in online videos,
we perform 3D reconstruction and obtain 3D trajectories of walking paths
augmented with additional information on the room types, object locations and
3D shape of surrounding scenes. Our dataset includes $\sim$100K open-ended
description-enriched trajectories with $\sim$200K instructions, and 17K
action-enriched trajectories from 1847 room tour environments. We demonstrate
experimentally that RoomTour3D enables significant improvements across multiple
VLN tasks including CVDN, SOON, R2R, and REVERIE. Moreover, RoomTour3D
facilitates the development of trainable zero-shot VLN agents, showcasing the
potential and challenges of advancing towards open-world navigation.

                                        <span>  Soft robots have the potential to interact with sensitive environments and
perform complex tasks effectively. However, motion plans and trajectories for
soft manipulators are challenging to calculate due to their deformable nature
and nonlinear dynamics. This article introduces a fast real-time trajectory
generation approach for soft robot manipulators, which creates
dynamically-feasible motions for arbitrary kinematically-feasible paths of the
robot's end effector. Our insight is that piecewise constant curvature (PCC)
dynamics models of soft robots can be differentially flat, therefore control
inputs can be calculated algebraically rather than through a nonlinear
differential equation. We prove this flatness under certain conditions, with
the curvatures of the robot as the flat outputs. Our two-step trajectory
generation approach uses an inverse kinematics procedure to calculate a motion
plan of robot curvatures per end-effector position, then, our flatness
diffeomorphism generates corresponding control inputs that respect velocity. We
validate our approach through simulations of our representative soft robot
manipulator along three different trajectories, demonstrating a margin of 23x
faster than real-time at a frequency of 100 Hz. This approach could allow fast
verifiable replanning of soft robots' motions in safety-critical physical
environments, crucial for deployment in the real world.

                                        <span>  Collaborative navigation becomes essential in situations of occluded
scenarios in autonomous driving where independent driving policies are likely
to lead to collisions. One promising approach to address this issue is through
the use of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) networks that allow for the sharing of
perception information with nearby agents, preventing catastrophic accidents.
In this article, we propose a collaborative control method based on a V2V
network for sharing compressed LiDAR features and employing Proximal Policy
Optimisation to train safe and efficient navigation policies. Unlike previous
approaches that rely on expert data (behaviour cloning), our proposed approach
learns the multi-agent policies directly from experience in the occluded
environment, while effectively meeting bandwidth limitations. The proposed
method first prepossesses LiDAR point cloud data to obtain meaningful features
through a convolutional neural network and then shares them with nearby CAVs to
alert for potentially dangerous situations. To evaluate the proposed method, we
developed an occluded intersection gym environment based on the CARLA
autonomous driving simulator, allowing real-time data sharing among agents. Our
experimental results demonstrate the consistent superiority of our
collaborative control method over an independent reinforcement learning method
and a cooperative early fusion method.

                                        <span>  Articulated object manipulation is a challenging task, requiring constrained
motion and adaptive control to handle the unknown dynamics of the manipulated
objects. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely employed to tackle
various scenarios and types of articulated objects, the complexity of these
tasks, stemming from multiple intertwined objectives makes learning a control
policy in the full task space highly difficult. To address this issue, we
propose a Subspace-wise hybrid RL (SwRL) framework that learns policies for
each divided task space, or subspace, based on independent objectives. This
approach enables adaptive force modulation to accommodate the unknown dynamics
of objects. Additionally, it effectively leverages the previously underlooked
redundant subspace, thereby maximizing the robot's dexterity. Our method
enhances both learning efficiency and task execution performance, as validated
through simulations and real-world experiments. Supplementary video is

                                        <span>  Multi-hand semantic grasp generation aims to generate feasible and
semantically appropriate grasp poses for different robotic hands based on
natural language instructions. Although the task is highly valuable, due to the
lack of multi-hand grasp datasets with fine-grained contact description between
robotic hands and objects, it is still a long-standing difficult task. In this
paper, we present Multi-GraspSet, the first large-scale multi-hand grasp
dataset with automatically contact annotations. Based on Multi-GraspSet, we
propose Multi-GraspLLM, a unified language-guided grasp generation framework.
It leverages large language models (LLM) to handle variable-length sequences,
generating grasp poses for diverse robotic hands in a single unified
architecture. Multi-GraspLLM first aligns the encoded point cloud features and
text features into a unified semantic space. It then generates grasp bin tokens
which are subsequently converted into grasp pose for each robotic hand via
hand-aware linear mapping. The experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods on Multi-GraspSet. More

increasingly making their mark in the entertainment industry. However,
designing smooth and safe choreographies for drone swarms is complex and often
requires expert domain knowledge. In this work, we introduce
SwarmGPT-Primitive, a language-based choreographer that integrates the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with safe motion
planning to facilitate deployable drone swarm choreographies. The LLM composes
choreographies for a given piece of music by utilizing a library of motion
primitives; the language-based choreographer is augmented with an
optimization-based safety filter, which certifies the choreography for
real-world deployment by making minimal adjustments when feasibility and safety
constraints are violated. The overall SwarmGPT-Primitive framework decouples
choreographic design from safe motion planning, which allows non-expert users
to re-prompt and refine compositions without concerns about compliance with
constraints such as avoiding collisions or downwash effects or satisfying
actuation limits. We demonstrate our approach through simulations and
experiments with swarms of up to 20 drones performing choreographies designed
based on various songs, highlighting the system's ability to generate effective
and synchronized drone choreographies for real-world deployment.

robot manipulation tasks. An approach to solve this problem is to leverage
simulation to create large datasets of pairs of objects and grasp poses, and
then learn a conditional generative model that can be prompted quickly during
deployment. However, the grasp pose data is highly multimodal since there are
several ways to grasp an object. Hence, in this work, we learn a grasp
generative model with diffusion models to sample candidate grasp poses given a
partial point cloud of an object. A novel aspect of our method is to consider
diffusion in the manifold space of rotations and to propose a
collision-avoidance cost guidance to improve the grasp success rate during
inference. To accelerate grasp sampling we use recent techniques from the
diffusion literature to achieve faster inference times. We show in simulation
and real-world experiments that our approach can grasp several objects from raw
depth images with $90\%$ success rate and benchmark it against several
baselines.

approaches often have long optimization times, while data-driven methods
struggle with unseen objects. This paper formulates the problem as a rigid
shape matching between gripper and object, which optimizes with Annealed Stein
Iterative Closest Point (AS-ICP) and leverages GPU-based parallelization. By
incorporating the gripper's tool center point and the object's center of mass
into the cost function and using a signed distance field of the gripper for
collision checking, our method achieves robust grasps with low computational

0.926 s computation time across various objects and settings, highlighting its
potential for real-world applications.

network including parametric bias and stochastic elements, and an
environmentally adaptive robot control method including variance minimization
using the model. Robots which have flexible bodies or whose states can only be
partially observed are difficult to modelize, and their predictive models often
have stochastic behaviors. In addition, the physical state of the robot and the
surrounding environment change sequentially, and so the predictive model can
change online. Therefore, in this study, we construct a learning-based
stochastic predictive model implemented in a neural network embedded with such
information from the experience of the robot, and develop a control method for
the robot to avoid unstable motion with large variance while adapting to the
current environment. This method is verified through a mobile robot in
simulation and to the actual robot Fetch.

                                        <span>  We aim to develop a model-based planning framework for world models that can
be scaled with increasing model and data budgets for general-purpose
manipulation tasks with only language and vision inputs. To this end, we
present FLow-centric generative Planning (FLIP), a model-based planning
algorithm on visual space that features three key modules: 1. a multi-modal
flow generation model as the general-purpose action proposal module; 2. a
flow-conditioned video generation model as the dynamics module; and 3. a
vision-language representation learning model as the value module. Given an
initial image and language instruction as the goal, FLIP can progressively
search for long-horizon flow and video plans that maximize the discounted
return to accomplish the task. FLIP is able to synthesize long-horizon plans
across objects, robots, and tasks with image flows as the general action
representation, and the dense flow information also provides rich guidance for
long-horizon video generation. In addition, the synthesized flow and video
plans can guide the training of low-level control policies for robot execution.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FLIP can improve both the
success rates and quality of long-horizon video plan synthesis and has the
interactive world model property, opening up wider applications for future
works.

                                        <span>  Off-road environments present significant challenges for autonomous ground
vehicles due to the absence of structured roads and the presence of complex
obstacles, such as uneven terrain, vegetation, and occlusions. Traditional
perception algorithms, designed primarily for structured environments, often
fail under these conditions, leading to inaccurate traversability estimations.
In this paper, ORDformer, a novel multimodal method that combines LiDAR point
clouds with monocular images, is proposed to generate dense traversable
occupancy predictions from a forward-facing perspective. By integrating
multimodal data, environmental feature extraction is enhanced, which is crucial
for accurate occupancy estimation in complex terrains. Furthermore, RELLIS-OCC,
a dataset with 3D traversable occupancy annotations, is introduced,
incorporating geometric features such as step height, slope, and unevenness.
Through a comprehensive analysis of vehicle obstacle-crossing conditions and
the incorporation of vehicle body structure constraints, four traversability
cost labels are generated: lethal, medium-cost, low-cost, and free.
Experimental results demonstrate that ORDformer outperforms existing approaches
in 3D traversable area recognition, particularly in off-road environments with
irregular geometries and partial occlusions. Specifically, ORDformer achieves
over a 20\% improvement in scene completion IoU compared to other models. The
proposed framework is scalable and adaptable to various vehicle platforms,
allowing for adjustments to occupancy grid parameters and the integration of
advanced dynamic models for traversability cost estimation.

                                        <span>  Most existing visual-inertial odometry (VIO) initialization methods rely on
accurate pre-calibrated extrinsic parameters. However, during long-term use,
irreversible structural deformation caused by temperature changes, mechanical
squeezing, etc. will cause changes in extrinsic parameters, especially in the
rotational part. Existing initialization methods that simultaneously estimate
extrinsic parameters suffer from poor robustness, low precision, and long
initialization latency due to the need for sufficient translational motion. To
address these problems, we propose a novel VIO initialization method, which
jointly considers extrinsic orientation and gyroscope bias within the normal
epipolar constraints, achieving higher precision and better robustness without
delayed rotational calibration. First, a rotation-only constraint is designed
for extrinsic orientation and gyroscope bias estimation, which tightly couples
gyroscope measurements and visual observations and can be solved in
pure-rotation cases. Second, we propose a weighting strategy together with a
failure detection strategy to enhance the precision and robustness of the
estimator. Finally, we leverage Maximum A Posteriori to refine the results
before enough translation parallax comes. Extensive experiments have
demonstrated that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both
accuracy and robustness while maintaining competitive efficiency.

humans and robots coexist. Moreover, the introduction of high quality legged
robots into workplaces highlighted the crucial role of a robust, fully
autonomous safety solution for robots to be viable in shared spaces or in
co-existence with humans. This article establishes for the first time ever an
innovative Detect-Track-and-Avoid Architecture (DTAA) to enhance safety and
overall mission performance. The proposed novel architectyre has the merit ot
integrating object detection using YOLOv8, utilizing Ultralytics embedded
object tracking, and state estimation of tracked objects through Kalman
filters. Moreover, a novel heuristic clustering is employed to facilitate
active avoidance of multiple closely positioned objects with similar
velocities, creating sets of unsafe spaces for the Nonlinear Model Predictive
Controller (NMPC) to navigate around. The NMPC identifies the most hazardous
unsafe space, considering not only their current positions but also their
predicted future locations. In the sequel, the NMPC calculates maneuvers to
guide the robot along a path planned by D$^{*}_{+}$ towards its intended
destination, while maintaining a safe distance to all identified obstacles. The
efficacy of the novelly suggested DTAA framework is being validated by
Real-life experiments featuring a Boston Dynamics Spot robot that demonstrates
the robot's capability to consistently maintain a safe distance from humans in
dynamic subterranean, urban indoor, and outdoor environments.

In this method, a depth map is inferred from an ``event focal stack'' composed

synthesized event focal stacks. The synthesized event stream is created from a
focal stack generated by Blender for any arbitrary 3D scene. This allows for
training on scenes with diverse structures. Additionally, we explored methods
to eliminate the domain gap between real event streams and synthetic event
streams. Our method demonstrates superior performance over a depth-from-defocus
method in the image domain on synthetic and real datasets.

                                        <span>  Autonomous air taxis are poised to revolutionize urban mass transportation,
however, ensuring their safety and reliability remains an open challenge.
Validating autonomy solutions on air taxis in the real world presents
complexities, risks, and costs that further convolute this challenge.
Verification and Validation (V&V) frameworks play a crucial role in the design
and development of highly reliable systems by formally verifying safety
properties and validating algorithm behavior across diverse operational
scenarios. Advancements in high-fidelity simulators have significantly enhanced
their capability to emulate real-world conditions, encouraging their use for
validating autonomous air taxi solutions, especially during early development
stages. This evolution underscores the growing importance of simulation
environments, not only as complementary tools to real-world testing but as
essential platforms for evaluating algorithms in a controlled, reproducible,
and scalable manner.
  This work presents a V&V framework for a vision-based landing system for air
taxis with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities. Specifically, we
use Verse, a tool for formal verification, to model and verify the safety of
the system by obtaining and analyzing the reachable sets. To conduct this
analysis, we utilize a photorealistic simulation environment. The simulation
environment, built on Unreal Engine, provides realistic terrain, weather, and
sensor characteristics to emulate real-world conditions with high fidelity. To
validate the safety analysis results, we conduct extensive scenario-based
testing to assess the reachability set and robustness of the landing algorithm
in various conditions. This approach showcases the representativeness of
high-fidelity simulators, offering an effective means to analyze and refine
algorithms before real-world deployment.

limiting their utility for evaluating robotic performance in dynamic
environments. To address this, we present a mobile robot oriented large-scale
indoor dataset, denoted as THUD++ (TsingHua University Dynamic) robotic
dataset, for dynamic scene understanding. Our current dataset includes 13
large-scale dynamic scenarios, combining both real-world and synthetic data
collected with a real robot platform and a physical simulation platform,
respectively. The RGB-D dataset comprises over 90K image frames, 20M 2D/3D
bounding boxes of static and dynamic objects, camera poses, and IMU. The
trajectory dataset covers over 6,000 pedestrian trajectories in indoor scenes.
Additionally, the dataset is augmented with a Unity3D-based simulation
platform, allowing researchers to create custom scenes and test algorithms in a
controlled environment. We evaluate state-of-the-art methods on THUD++ across
mainstream indoor scene understanding tasks, e.g., 3D object detection,
semantic segmentation, relocalization, pedestrian trajectory prediction, and
navigation. Our experiments highlight the challenges mobile robots encounter in
indoor environments, especially when navigating in complex, crowded, and
dynamic scenes. By sharing this dataset, we aim to accelerate the development
and testing of mobile robot algorithms, contributing to real-world robotic
applications.

robotic C-arm X-ray systems, making advanced functionality and controls
accessible. However, enabling language interfaces requires specialized AI
models that interpret X-ray images to create a semantic representation for
reasoning. The fixed outputs of such AI models limit the functionality of
language controls. Incorporating flexible, language-aligned AI models prompted
through language enables more versatile interfaces for diverse tasks and
procedures. Using a language-aligned foundation model for X-ray image
segmentation, our system continually updates a patient digital twin based on
sparse reconstructions of desired anatomical structures. This supports
autonomous capabilities such as visualization, patient-specific viewfinding,
and automatic collimation from novel viewpoints, enabling commands 'Focus in on
the lower lumbar vertebrae.' In a cadaver study, users visualized, localized,
and collimated structures across the torso using verbal commands, achieving 84%
end-to-end success. Post hoc analysis of randomly oriented images showed our
patient digital twin could localize 35 commonly requested structures to within
51.68 mm, enabling localization and isolation from arbitrary orientations. Our
results demonstrate how intelligent robotic X-ray systems can incorporate
physicians' expressed intent directly. While existing foundation models for
intra-operative X-ray analysis exhibit failure modes, as they improve, they can
facilitate highly flexible, intelligent robotic C-arms.

generalization capability of the proposed RL algorithm by training it on both
the Go1 and Ask1 robots. Simulation and real-world experiments validate the
effectiveness of this method, showing that Ask1, like the Go1, is capable of
navigating various rugged terrains.

to user preferences and improve safety. Existing approaches typically consider
a single querying (interaction) format when seeking human feedback and do not
leverage multiple modes of user interaction with a robot. We examine how to
learn a penalty function associated with unsafe behaviors, such as side
effects, using multiple forms of human feedback, by optimizing the query state
and feedback format. Our framework for adaptive feedback selection enables
querying for feedback in critical states in the most informative format, while
accounting for the cost and probability of receiving feedback in a certain
format. We employ an iterative, two-phase approach which first selects critical
states for querying, and then uses information gain to select a feedback format
for querying across the sampled critical states. Our evaluation in simulation
demonstrates the sample efficiency of our approach.

conflicting; some tasks require precise motion while others require force
compliance; some tasks require avoidance of certain regions, while others
require convergence to certain states. Satisfying these varied requirements
with a fixed state-action representation and control strategy is challenging,
impeding the development of a universal robotic foundation model. In this work,
we propose Meta-Control, the first LLM-enabled automatic control synthesis
approach that creates customized state representations and control strategies
tailored to specific tasks. Our core insight is that a meta-control system can
be built to automate the thought process that human experts use to design
control systems. Specifically, human experts heavily use a model-based,
hierarchical (from abstract to concrete) thought model, then compose various
dynamic models and controllers together to form a control system. Meta-Control
mimics the thought model and harnesses LLM's extensive control knowledge with
Socrates' "art of midwifery" to automate the thought process. Meta-Control
stands out for its fully model-based nature, allowing rigorous analysis,
generalizability, robustness, efficient parameter tuning, and reliable
real-time execution.

detecting and reacting to perturbations before the user. Although commonly
used, the standard metric for perturbation detection, whole-body angular
momentum, is poorly suited for exoskeleton applications due to computational
delays and additional tunings. To address this, we developed a novel ground
perturbation detector using lower-limb kinematic states during locomotion. To
identify perturbations, we tracked deviations in the kinematic states from
their nominal steady-state trajectories. Using a data-driven approach, we
further optimized our detector with an open-source ground perturbation
biomechanics dataset. A pilot experimental validation with five able-bodied
subjects demonstrated that our model detected ground perturbations with 97.8%
accuracy and only a delay of 23.1% within the gait cycle, outperforming the
benchmark by 46.8% in detection accuracy. The results of our study offer
exciting promise for our detector and its potential utility to enhance the
controllability of robotic assistive exoskeletons.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose Lan-grasp, a novel approach towards more
appropriate semantic grasping. We use foundation models to provide the robot
with a deeper understanding of the objects, the right place to grasp an object,
or even the parts to avoid. This allows our robot to grasp and utilize objects
in a more meaningful and safe manner. We leverage the combination of a Large
Language Model, a Vision Language Model, and a traditional grasp planner to
generate grasps demonstrating a deeper semantic understanding of the objects.
We first prompt the Large Language Model about which object part is appropriate
for grasping. Next, the Vision Language Model identifies the corresponding part
in the object image. Finally, we generate grasp proposals in the region
proposed by the Vision Language Model. Building on foundation models provides
us with a zero-shot grasp method that can handle a wide range of objects
without the need for further training or fine-tuning. We evaluated our method
in real-world experiments on a custom object data set. We present the results
of a survey that asks the participants to choose an object part appropriate for
grasping. The results show that the grasps generated by our method are
consistently ranked higher by the participants than those generated by a
conventional grasping planner and a recent semantic grasping approach. In
addition, we propose a Visual Chain-of-Thought feedback loop to assess grasp
feasibility in complex scenarios. This mechanism enables dynamic reasoning and
generates alternative grasp strategies when needed, ensuring safer and more
effective grasping outcomes.

interaction-rich tasks and will be a key enabler for In-Space Servicing,
Assembly and Manufacturing (ISAM) activities. This paper introduces the
software architecture used on the On-Board Computer (OBC) for the planned
SpaceDREAM mission aiming to validate such robotic arm in Lower Earth Orbit
(LEO) conducted by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in cooperation with
KINETIK Space GmbH and the Technical University of Munich (TUM). During the
mission several free motion as well as contact tasks are to be performed in
order to verify proper functionality of the robot in position and impedance
control on joint level as well as in cartesian control. The tasks are selected
to be representative for subsequent servicing missions e.g. requiring interface
docking or precise manipulation.
  The software on the OBC commands the robot's joints via SpaceWire to perform
those mission tasks, reads camera images and data from additional sensors and
sends telemetry data through an Ethernet link via the spacecraft down to Earth.
It is set up to execute a predefined mission after receiving a start signal
from the spacecraft while it should be extendable to receive commands from
Earth for later missions. Core design principle was to reuse as much existing
software and to stay as close as possible to existing robot software stacks at
DLR. This allowed for a quick full operational start of the robot arm compared
to a custom development of all robot software, a lower entry barrier for
software developers as well as a reuse of existing libraries. While not every
line of code can be tested with this design, most of the software has already
proven its functionality through daily execution on multiple robot systems.

                                        <span>  We address the problem of robot guided assembly tasks, by using a
learning-based approach to identify contact model parameters for known and
novel parts. First, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is used to extract
geometric features of assembly parts. Then, we combine the extracted features
with physical knowledge to derive the parameters of a contact model using our
newly proposed neural network structure. The measured force from real
experiments is used to supervise the predicted forces, thus avoiding the need
for ground truth model parameters. Although trained only on a small set of
assembly parts, good contact model estimation for unknown objects were
achieved. Our main contribution is the network structure that allows us to
estimate contact models of assembly tasks depending on the geometry of the part
to be joined. Where current system identification processes have to record new
data for a new assembly process, our method only requires the 3D model of the
assembly part. We evaluate our method by estimating contact models for
robot-guided assembly tasks of pin connectors as well as electronic plugs and
compare the results with real experiments.

                                        <span>  Dexterous manipulation with contact-rich interactions is crucial for advanced
robotics. While recent diffusion-based planning approaches show promise for
simpler manipulation tasks, they often produce unrealistic ghost states (e.g.,
the object automatically moves without hand contact) or lack adaptability when
handling complex sequential interactions. In this work, we introduce
DexHandDiff, an interaction-aware diffusion planning framework for adaptive
dexterous manipulation. DexHandDiff models joint state-action dynamics through
a dual-phase diffusion process which consists of pre-interaction contact
alignment and post-contact goal-directed control, enabling goal-adaptive
generalizable dexterous manipulation. Additionally, we incorporate dynamics
model-based dual guidance and leverage large language models for automated
guidance function generation, enhancing generalizability for physical
interactions and facilitating diverse goal adaptation through language cues.
Experiments on physical interaction tasks such as door opening, pen and block
re-orientation, and hammer striking demonstrate DexHandDiff's effectiveness on
goals outside training distributions, achieving over twice the average success
rate (59.2% vs. 29.5%) compared to existing methods. Our framework achieves
70.0% success on 30-degree door opening, 40.0% and 36.7% on pen and block
half-side re-orientation respectively, and 46.7% on hammer nail half drive,
highlighting its robustness and flexibility in contact-rich manipulation.

new tasks by generating a set of skills from user-provided demonstrations.
These skills can then be sequenced by planning algorithms to execute complex
tasks. However, LfD systems typically require a full demonstration of the
entire task, even when parts of it are already known to the robot. This
limitation comes from the system's inability to recognize which sub-tasks are
already familiar, leading to a repetitive and burdensome demonstration process
for users. In this paper, we introduce a new method for guided demonstrations
that reduces this burden, by helping the robot to identify which parts of the
task it already knows, considering the overall task goal and the robot's
existing skills. In particular, through a combinatorial search, the method
finds the smallest necessary change in the initial task conditions that allows
the robot to solve the task with its current knowledge. This state is referred
to as the excuse state. The human demonstrator is then only required to teach
how to reach the excuse state (missing sub-task), rather than demonstrating the
entire task. Empirical results and a pilot user study show that our method
reduces demonstration time by 61% and decreases the size of demonstrations by
72%.

single inference and regard every prediction as independent of others. This may
cause inconsistent segmentation results for the same object in different
frames. To overcome this issue, we propose a streaming network with a memory
mechanism, called StreamMOS, to build the association of features and
predictions among multiple inferences. Specifically, we utilize a short-term
memory to convey historical features, which can be regarded as spatial prior of
moving objects and adopted to enhance current inference by temporal fusion.
Meanwhile, we build a long-term memory to store previous predictions and
exploit them to refine the present forecast at voxel and instance levels
through voting. Besides, we present multi-view encoder with cascade projection
and asymmetric convolution to extract motion feature of objects in different
representations. Extensive experiments validate that our algorithm gets
competitive performance on SemanticKITTI and Sipailou Campus datasets. Code
will be released at https://github.com/NEU-REAL/StreamMOS.git.

people's spatial attention and other mental states. This leads to a dual role
for the eyes as a means of sensing and communication. Accordingly, artificial
eye models are being explored as communication media in human-machine
interaction scenarios. One challenge in the use of eye models for communication
consists of resolving spatial reference ambiguities, especially for
screen-based models. Here, we introduce an approach for overcoming this
challenge through the introduction of reflection-like features that are
contingent on artificial eye movements. We conducted a user study with 30
participants in which participants had to use spatial references provided by
dynamic eye models to advance in a fast-paced group interaction task. Compared
to a non-reflective eye model and a pure reflection mode, their combination in
the new approach resulted in a higher identification accuracy and user
experience, suggesting a synergistic benefit.

                                        <span>  The collaborative visual perception of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) has increasingly become a research hotspot. Compared to a single UAV
equipped with a short-baseline stereo camera, multi-UAV collaborative vision
offers a wide and variable baseline, providing potential benefits in flexible
and large-scale depth perception. In this paper, we propose the concept of a
collaborative stereo camera, where the left and right cameras are mounted on
two UAVs that share an overlapping FOV. Considering the dynamic flight of two
UAVs in the real world, the FOV and relative pose of the left and right cameras
are continuously changing. Compared to fixed-baseline stereo cameras, this
aerial collaborative stereo system introduces two challenges, which are highly
real-time requirements for dynamic cross-camera stereo feature association and
relative pose estimation of left and right cameras. To address these
challenges, we first propose a real-time dual-channel feature association
algorithm with a guidance-prediction structure. Then, we propose a Relative
Multi-State Constrained Kalman Filter (Rel-MSCKF) algorithm to estimate the
relative pose by fusing co-visual features and UAVs' visual-inertial odometry
(VIO). Extensive experiments are performed on the popular onboard computer
NVIDIA NX. Results on the resource-constrained platform show that the real-time
performance of the dual-channel feature association is significantly superior
to traditional methods. The convergence of Rel-MSCKF is assessed under
different initial baseline errors. In the end, we present a potential
application of aerial collaborative stereo for remote mapping obstacles in
urban scenarios. We hope this work can serve as a foundational study for more
multi-UAV collaborative vision research. Online video:

                                        <span>  Autonomous manipulation in everyday tasks requires flexible action generation
to handle complex, diverse real-world environments, such as objects with
varying hardness and softness. Imitation Learning (IL) enables robots to learn
complex tasks from expert demonstrations. However, a lot of existing methods
rely on position/unilateral control, leaving challenges in tasks that require
force information/control, like carefully grasping fragile or varying-hardness
objects. As the need for diverse controls increases, there are demand for
low-cost bimanual robots that consider various motor inputs. To address these
challenges, we introduce Bilateral Control-Based Imitation Learning via Action
Chunking with Transformers(Bi-ACT) and"A" "L"ow-cost "P"hysical "Ha"rdware
Considering Diverse Motor Control Modes for Research in Everyday Bimanual
Robotic Manipulation (ALPHA-$\alpha$). Bi-ACT leverages bilateral control to
utilize both position and force information, enhancing the robot's adaptability
to object characteristics such as hardness, shape, and weight. The concept of
ALPHA-$\alpha$ is affordability, ease of use, repairability, ease of assembly,
and diverse control modes (position, velocity, torque), allowing
researchers/developers to freely build control systems using ALPHA-$\alpha$. In
our experiments, we conducted a detailed analysis of Bi-ACT in unimanual
manipulation tasks, confirming its superior performance and adaptability
compared to Bi-ACT without force control. Based on these results, we applied
Bi-ACT to bimanual manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrated high
success rates in coordinated bimanual operations across multiple tasks. The
effectiveness of the Bi-ACT and ALPHA-$\alpha$ can be seen through
comprehensive real-world experiments. Video available at:

an ungraspable task, which poses significant challenges due to the unreachable
grasping poses. Previous works leverage Extrinsic Dexterity like walls or table
edges to grasp such objects. However, they are limited to task-specific
policies and lack task planning to find pre-grasp conditions. This makes it
difficult to adapt to various environments and extrinsic dexterity constraints.
Therefore, we present DexDiff, a robust robotic manipulation method for
long-horizon planning with extrinsic dexterity. Specifically, we utilize a
vision-language model (VLM) to perceive the environmental state and generate
high-level task plans, followed by a goal-conditioned action diffusion (GCAD)
model to predict the sequence of low-level actions. This model learns the
low-level policy from offline data with the cumulative reward guided by
high-level planning as the goal condition, which allows for improved prediction
of robot actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only
effectively performs ungraspable tasks but also generalizes to previously
unseen objects. It outperforms baselines by a 47% higher success rate in
simulation and facilitates efficient deployment and manipulation in real-world
scenarios.

using real-world mobility datasets from nine cities and calibrated customers'
price and detour elasticity. Through massive numerical experiments, this study
reveals that while ride-sharing can benefit social welfare, it may also lead to
a loss of revenue for transportation network companies (TNCs) or drivers
compared with solo-hailing, which limits TNCs' motivation to develop
ride-sharing services. Three key factors contributing to this revenue loss are
identified: (1) the low successful sharing ratio for customers choosing
ride-sharing in some cases, (2) the limited saved trip distance by pooling two
customers, and (3) the potential revenue loss when pooling customers with
significantly different trip fares. Furthermore, this study finds that the
monetary benefits of carbon emission reductions from ride-sharing are not
substantial enough to affect customers' choices between solo-hailing and
ride-sharing. The findings provide a valuable reference for TNCs and
governments. For TNCs, effective pricing strategies, such as dynamic pricing,
should be designed to prevent revenue loss when introducing ride-sharing.
Governments are suggested to subsidize ride-sharing services to solve the
development dilemma and maintain or even increase social welfare benefits from
ride-sharing, including reduced carbon emissions and improved vehicle occupancy
rates.

  Key enabling technologies such as Performance Based Navigation (PBN), data
communications, and System-wide Information Management (SWIM) are discussed,
showcasing their roles in rapid information exchange and trajectory
optimization. A live flight case study demonstrates TBO concepts through
international collaboration, indicating significant improvements in safety,
efficiency, and sustainability.
  The paper presents results from TBO prototype implementations, including
enhanced trajectory accuracy, improved flight path efficiency, and real-time
adjustments based on evolving conditions. The integration of advanced
trajectory optimization engines and automation within the FOC has led to more
effective flight planning, allowing airlines to negotiate trajectory changes
dynamically and optimize operations throughout the flight lifecycle.
  Findings suggest that TBO can enhance operational predictability,
flexibility, and strategic planning while reducing uncertainty and improving
alignment between strategic and tactical actions. Key conclusions include: TBO
is feasible with most currently flying commercial aircraft; full TBO
implementation can lead to a greener, more efficient aviation industry with
widespread benefits; and continued collaboration among stakeholders is
essential for the further development and realization of TBO.

                                        <span>  Traditional wireless network design relies on optimization algorithms derived
from domain-specific mathematical models, which are often inefficient and
unsuitable for dynamic, real-time applications due to high complexity. Deep
learning has emerged as a promising alternative to overcome complexity and
adaptability concerns, but it faces challenges such as accuracy issues, delays,
and limited interpretability due to its inherent black-box nature. This paper
introduces a novel approach that integrates optimization theory with deep
learning methodologies to address these issues. The methodology starts by
constructing the block diagram of the optimization theory-based solution,
identifying key building blocks corresponding to optimality conditions and
iterative solutions. Selected building blocks are then replaced with deep
neural networks, enhancing the adaptability and interpretability of the system.
Extensive simulations show that this hybrid approach not only reduces runtime
compared to optimization theory based approaches but also significantly
improves accuracy and convergence rates, outperforming pure deep learning
models.

                                        <span>  Soft robots have the potential to interact with sensitive environments and
perform complex tasks effectively. However, motion plans and trajectories for
soft manipulators are challenging to calculate due to their deformable nature
and nonlinear dynamics. This article introduces a fast real-time trajectory
generation approach for soft robot manipulators, which creates
dynamically-feasible motions for arbitrary kinematically-feasible paths of the
robot's end effector. Our insight is that piecewise constant curvature (PCC)
dynamics models of soft robots can be differentially flat, therefore control
inputs can be calculated algebraically rather than through a nonlinear
differential equation. We prove this flatness under certain conditions, with
the curvatures of the robot as the flat outputs. Our two-step trajectory
generation approach uses an inverse kinematics procedure to calculate a motion
plan of robot curvatures per end-effector position, then, our flatness
diffeomorphism generates corresponding control inputs that respect velocity. We
validate our approach through simulations of our representative soft robot
manipulator along three different trajectories, demonstrating a margin of 23x
faster than real-time at a frequency of 100 Hz. This approach could allow fast
verifiable replanning of soft robots' motions in safety-critical physical
environments, crucial for deployment in the real world.

                                        <span>  Modern power grids are evolving to become more interconnected, include more
electric vehicles (EVs), and utilize more renewable energy sources (RES).
Increased interconnectivity provides an opportunity to manage EVs and RES by
using price signaling to shift EV loads towards periods of high RES output.
This work uses ERCOT's 2035 RES installation plans and projections for Texas's
EV fleet to examine and compare how both open-loop control and model predictive
control (MPC) schemes can leverage time varying rates for EV charging to
utilize excess RES supply that may otherwise be underutilized in a highly
weather-dependent grid. The results show that while open-loop control increases
RES usage, MPC increases RES usage even further by responding to RES outputs
that differ from forecasts due to the inherent uncertainty of weather
predictions. If MPC is used with time steps that are too frequent, however,
difficulties arise; EV owners may find it too onerous to keep up with changing
price structures, and frequent over-corrections to charging profiles can lead
to a ``rebound peak" phenomenon. Therefore, control schemes should balance
maximizing RES usage with ensuring customer participation.

excitation and partial measurement when the network dynamics is linear on the
edges and nonlinear on the nodes. We assume that the graph topology and the
nonlinear functions at the node level are known, and we aim to identify the
weight matrix of the graph. Our main result is to prove that fully-connected
layered feed-forward networks are generically locally identifiable by exciting
sources and measuring sinks in the class of analytic functions that cross the
origin. This holds even when all other nodes remain unexcited and unmeasured
and stands in sharp contrast to most findings on network identifiability
requiring measurement and/or excitation of each node. The result applies in
particular to feed-forward artificial neural networks with no offsets and
generalizes previous literature by considering a broader class of functions and
topologies.

increasingly making their mark in the entertainment industry. However,
designing smooth and safe choreographies for drone swarms is complex and often
requires expert domain knowledge. In this work, we introduce
SwarmGPT-Primitive, a language-based choreographer that integrates the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with safe motion
planning to facilitate deployable drone swarm choreographies. The LLM composes
choreographies for a given piece of music by utilizing a library of motion
primitives; the language-based choreographer is augmented with an
optimization-based safety filter, which certifies the choreography for
real-world deployment by making minimal adjustments when feasibility and safety
constraints are violated. The overall SwarmGPT-Primitive framework decouples
choreographic design from safe motion planning, which allows non-expert users
to re-prompt and refine compositions without concerns about compliance with
constraints such as avoiding collisions or downwash effects or satisfying
actuation limits. We demonstrate our approach through simulations and
experiments with swarms of up to 20 drones performing choreographies designed
based on various songs, highlighting the system's ability to generate effective
and synchronized drone choreographies for real-world deployment.

distribution networks (ADNs) leads to complex and uncertain operation
scenarios, resulting in significant deviations and risks for the ADN operation.
In this study, a collaborative capacity planning of the distributed energy
resources in an ADN is proposed to enhance the RES accommodation capability.
The variability of RESs, characteristics of adjustable demand response
resources, ADN bi-directional power flow, and security operation limitations
are considered in the proposed model. To address the noise term caused by the
inevitable deviation between the operation simulation and real-world
environments, an improved noise-aware Bayesian optimization algorithm with the
probabilistic surrogate model is proposed to overcome the interference from the
environmental noise and sample-efficiently optimize the capacity planning model
under noisy circumstances. Numerical simulation results verify the superiority
of the proposed approach in coping with environmental noise and achieving lower
annual cost and higher computation efficiency.

                                        <span>  We establish a high-precision composite model for a piezoelectric fast
steering mirror (PFSM) using a Hammerstein structure. A novel asymmetric
Bouc-Wen model is proposed to describe the nonlinear rate-independent
hysteresis, while a dynamic model is derived to represent the linear
rate-dependent component. By analyzing the physical process from the
displacement of the piezoelectric actuator to the angle of the PFSM, cross-axis
coupling is modeled based on first principles. Given the dynamic isolation of
each module on different frequency scales, a step-by-step method for model
parameter identification is carried out. Finally, experimental results
demonstrate that the identified parameters can accurately represent the
hysteresis, creep, and mechanical dynamic characteristics of the PFSM.
Furthermore, by comparing the outputs of the identified model with the real
PFSM under different excitation signals, the effectiveness of the proposed
dual-input dual-output composite model is validated.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes a novel method for identifying Th\'evenin equivalent
parameters (TEP) in power system, based on the statistical characteristics of
the system's stochastic response. The method leverages stochastic fluctuation
data under steady-state grid conditions and applies sliding window techniques
to compute sensitivity parameters between voltage magnitude, current magnitude
and power. This enables high-accuracy and robust TEP identification. In
contrast to traditional methods, the proposed approach does not rely on large
disturbances or probing signals but instead utilizes the natural fluctuation
behavior of the system. Additionally, the method supports distributed
implementation using local measurements of voltage magnitude, current
magnitude, and power, offering significant practical value for engineering
applications. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the method's robustness in
the presence of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), asynchronous measurements, and
data collinearity issues. Simulation results further confirm the effectiveness
of the proposed method in diverse practical scenarios, demonstrating its
ability to consistently provide accurate and reliable identification of TEP
using system ambient data.

                                        <span>  Multi-object tracking algorithms are deployed in various applications, each
with unique performance requirements. For example, track switches pose
significant challenges for offline scene understanding, as they hinder the
accuracy of data interpretation. Conversely, in online surveillance
applications, their impact is often minimal. This disparity underscores the
need for application-specific performance evaluations that are both simple and
mathematically sound. The trajectory generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment
(TGOSPA) metric offers a principled approach to evaluate multi-object tracking
performance. It accounts for localization errors, the number of missed and
false objects, and the number of track switches, providing a comprehensive
assessment framework. This paper illustrates the effective use of the TGOSPA
metric in computer vision tasks, addressing challenges posed by the need for
application-specific scoring methodologies. By exploring the TGOSPA parameter
selection, we enable users to compare, comprehend, and optimize the performance
of algorithms tailored for specific tasks, such as target tracking and training
of detector or re-ID modules.

                                        <span>  Simulation has become a crucial tool for Building Energy Optimization (BEO)
as it enables the evaluation of different design and control strategies at a
low cost. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can leverage large-scale simulations
to learn optimal control from vast amounts of data without supervision,
particularly under the Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm. Unfortunately, the
lack of open and standardized tools has hindered the widespread application of
ML and RL to BEO. To address this issue, this paper presents Sinergym, an
open-source Python-based virtual testbed for large-scale building simulation,
data collection, continuous control, and experiment monitoring. Sinergym
provides a consistent interface for training and running controllers,
predefined benchmarks, experiment visualization and replication support, and
comprehensive documentation in a ready-to-use software library. This paper 1)
highlights the main features of Sinergym in comparison to other existing
frameworks, 2) describes its basic usage, and 3) demonstrates its applicability
for RL-based BEO through several representative examples. By integrating
simulation, data, and control, Sinergym supports the development of
intelligent, data-driven applications for more efficient and responsive
building operations, aligning with the objectives of digital twin technology.

                                        <span>  Achieving global optimality in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is
challenging due to the non-convex nature of the underlying optimization
problem. Since commonly employed local optimization techniques depend on
carefully chosen initial guesses, this non-convexity often leads to suboptimal
performance resulting from local optima. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a novel diffusion model-based approach for near-globally optimal NMPC
consisting of an offline and an online phase. The offline phase employs a local
optimizer to sample from the distribution of optimal NMPC control sequences
along generated system trajectories through random initial guesses.
Subsequently, the generated diverse data set is used to train a diffusion model
to reflect the multi-modal distribution of optima. In the online phase, the
trained model is leveraged to efficiently perform a variant of random shooting
optimization to obtain near-globally optimal control sequences without relying
on any initial guesses or online NMPC solving. The effectiveness of our
approach is illustrated in a numerical simulation indicating high performance
benefits compared to direct neural network approximations of NMPC and
significantly lower computation times than online solving NMPC using global
optimizers.

has been a benchmark for neural operator approximations of PDE backstepping
controllers. Introducing a spatially-varying delay into the model gives rise to
a gain operator defined through integral equations which the operator's input
-- the varying delay function -- enters in previously unencountered manners,
including in the limits of integration and as the inverse of the `delayED time'
function. This, in turn, introduces novel mathematical challenges in estimating
the operator's Lipschitz constant. The backstepping kernel function having two
branches endows the feedback law with a two-branch structure, where only one of
the two feedback branches depends on both of the kernel branches. For this rich
feedback structure, we propose a neural operator approximation of such a
two-branch feedback law and prove the approximator to be semiglobally
practically stabilizing. With numerical results we illustrate the training of
the neural operator and its stabilizing capability.

                                        <span>  Traditional real-time operating systems (RTOS) often exhibit poor parallel
performance, while thread monitoring in Linux-based systems presents
significant challenges. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
satellite flight software system design based on the Robot Operating System
(ROS), leveraging ROS's built-in reliable publish-subscribe messaging mechanism
for inter-application communication. Considering the complex functional
requirements of modern small satellites, the design incorporates both hardware
and software architecture, alongside system scheduling and error-correction
mechanisms. This approach ensures efficient parallel data processing and system
reliability, while also reducing the development cycle through code reuse.
Comprehensive testing, including system time delay, system management, fault
tolerance, and system maintenance, was conducted to validate the system's
capabilities in telemetry, remote control, new feature integration, and
autonomous error correction. The results demonstrate the high reliability and
ease of maintenance of the satellite flight software offering a reference
framework for the rapid development of high-performance small satellite
operations systems.

                                        <span>  This paper investigates the impact of rigid communication topologies (RCTs)
on the performance of vehicular platoons, aiming to identify beneficial
features in RCTs that enhance vehicles behavior. We introduce four performance
metrics, focusing on safety, energy consumption, passenger comfort, and
robustness of vehicular platoons. The safety metric is based on momentary
distances between neighboring vehicles, their relative velocities, and relative
accelerations. Thus, to have access to these relative values, we formulate the
coupled dynamics between pairs of neighboring vehicles, considering initial
conditions (position, velocity, acceleration), leader vehicle's
velocity/acceleration trajectory, deployed RCT, and vehicles' parity/disparity.
By decoupling the dynamics using a mapping matrix structured on deployed RCT,
vehicles' features, and control gains, precise formulations for distance
errors, relative velocities, and relative accelerations between all neighboring
vehicles, over the travel time, are obtained. Comparing performance metric
results across RCTs highlights that downstream information transmission-from
vehicles ahead, particularly the leader vehicle, to vehicles
behind-significantly enhances platoon stability, safety, energy consumption,
and passenger comfort metrics. Conversely, receiving state information from
vehicles behind degrades metrics, compromising safety, increasing energy
consumption, and reducing passenger comfort. These findings underscore that
forward-looking, leader-centric communications between vehicles markedly
enhance platoon efficiency and safety.

model predictive control (MPC). Despite over twenty years of active research,
the offset-free MPC literature has not shaken the assumption of closed-loop
stability for establishing offset-free performance. In this paper, we present a
nonlinear offset-free MPC design that is robustly stable with respect to the
tracking errors, and thus achieves offset-free performance, despite plant-model
mismatch and persistent disturbances. Key features and assumptions of this
design include quadratic costs, differentiability of the plant and model
functions, constraint backoffs at steady state, and a robustly stable state and
disturbance estimator. We first establish nominal stability and offset-free
performance. Then, robustness to state and disturbance estimate errors and
setpoint and disturbance changes is demonstrated. Finally, the results are
extended to sufficiently small plant-model mismatch. The results are
illustrated by numerical examples.

full autonomy remains a significant challenge, requiring ongoing human
cognition in decision-making processes. Incorporating human cognition into
control algorithms has become increasingly important, as researchers work to
develop strategies that minimize conflicts between human drivers and AI
systems. Despite notable progress, many challenges persist, underscoring the
need for further innovation and refinement in this field. This review covers
recent progress in human-vehicle interaction (HVI) and AI collaboration for
vehicle control. First, we start by looking at how HVI has evolved, pointing
out key developments and identifying persistent problems. Second, we discuss
the existing techniques, including methods for integrating human intuition and
cognition into decision-making processes and developing systems that can mimic
human behavior to enable optimal driving strategies and achieve safer and more
efficient transportation. This review aims to contribute to the development of
more effective and adaptive automated driving systems by enhancing human-AI

reachability problem in terms of probability measures, capturing the
probability measure of the state of the system that satisfies the reachability
specification for all probabilities over a finite horizon. We achieve this by
constructing the level sets of the probability measure for all probability
values and, since our approach is only for autonomous systems, we can determine
the level sets via forward simulations of the system from a point in the state
space at some time step in the finite horizon to estimate the reach
probability. We devise a training procedure which exploits this forward
simulation and employ it to design a deep neural network (DNN) to predict the
reach probability provided the current state and time step. We validate the
effectiveness of our approach through three examples.

                                        <span>  The requirements for real-world manipulation tasks are diverse and often
conflicting; some tasks require precise motion while others require force
compliance; some tasks require avoidance of certain regions, while others
require convergence to certain states. Satisfying these varied requirements
with a fixed state-action representation and control strategy is challenging,
impeding the development of a universal robotic foundation model. In this work,
we propose Meta-Control, the first LLM-enabled automatic control synthesis
approach that creates customized state representations and control strategies
tailored to specific tasks. Our core insight is that a meta-control system can
be built to automate the thought process that human experts use to design
control systems. Specifically, human experts heavily use a model-based,
hierarchical (from abstract to concrete) thought model, then compose various
dynamic models and controllers together to form a control system. Meta-Control
mimics the thought model and harnesses LLM's extensive control knowledge with
Socrates' "art of midwifery" to automate the thought process. Meta-Control
stands out for its fully model-based nature, allowing rigorous analysis,
generalizability, robustness, efficient parameter tuning, and reliable
real-time execution.

metamaterials that can swiftly manipulate their EM characteristics to convey
specific information. Past researches present various strategies for embedding
information within ambient EM waves through the superposition of time-varying
quantized properties for each unit. Despite their capabilities, these
approaches alone are insufficient for concurrently but independently realizing
the creation of information and the allocation of spatial energy. In this work,
we introduce a comprehensive approach named the space-time decoupled
metasurface (STD-Metasurface), facilitating the simultaneous and independent
control of information modulation and passive beamforming by incorporating
reflective mixer and phase shifter functionalities into each unit. As a proof
of concept, we present a minimalist design of single-diode unit where the
ingenious utilization of analog switch bonds the digital signal and analog
signal together. By inputting baseband analogue signals in a specific level
range, STD-Metasurface prototype is capable of modulating them onto the
envelopes of reflected EM waves without distortion meanwhile controlling the
reflected radiation patterns by digital signals, even waveform superposition
and spatial multiplexing. To demonstrate the superior capabilities of the
STD-Metasurface, we have developed an experimental platform to highlight its
practicality and potential applications as a reconfigurable backscatter
transmitter and a dynamic Doppler-spoofing reflector array.

                                        <span>  Practical Bayes filters often assume the state distribution of each time step
to be Gaussian for computational tractability, resulting in the so-called
Gaussian filters. When facing nonlinear systems, Gaussian filters such as
extended Kalman filter (EKF) or unscented Kalman filter (UKF) typically rely on
certain linearization techniques, which can introduce large estimation errors.
To address this issue, this paper reconstructs the prediction and update steps
of Gaussian filtering as solutions to two distinct optimization problems, whose
optimal conditions are found to have analytical forms from Stein's lemma. It is
observed that the stationary point for the prediction step requires calculating
the first two moments of the prior distribution, which is equivalent to that
step in existing moment-matching filters. In the update step, instead of
linearizing the model to approximate the stationary points, we propose an
iterative approach to directly minimize the update step's objective to avoid
linearization errors. For the purpose of performing the steepest descent on the
Gaussian manifold, we derive its natural gradient that leverages Fisher
information matrix to adjust the gradient direction, accounting for the
curvature of the parameter space. Combining this update step with moment
matching in the prediction step, we introduce a new iterative filter for
nonlinear systems called \textit{N}atural Gr\textit{a}dient Gaussia\textit{n}
Appr\textit{o}ximation filter, or NANO filter for short. We prove that NANO
filter locally converges to the optimal Gaussian approximation at each time
step. Furthermore, the estimation error is proven exponentially bounded for
nearly linear measurement equation and low noise levels through constructing a
supermartingale-like property across consecutive time steps.

procedure has become widespread as it allows one to describe major of adaptive
control problems in unified terms of the parameter estimation problem of a
regression equation with a scalar regressor. However, when the
system/parameterization is affected by perturbations, the estimation laws,
which are designed on the basis of such equation, asymptotically provides only
biased estimates. In this paper, based on the bias-eliminated least-squares
(BELS) approach, a modification of DREM procedure is proposed to annihilate
perturbations asymptotically and, consequently, asymptotically obtain unbiased
estimates. The theoretical results are supported with mathematical modelling
and can be used to design adaptive observers and control systems.

nearly passive elements with software-tunable electromagnetic properties to
dynamically manipulate the reflection/transmission of radio signals. Research
works in this area are focused on two applications, namely {\it user-assist}
RIS aiming at tuning the RIS to enhance the quality-of-service (QoS) of target
users, and the {\it malicious} RIS aiming for an attacker to degrade the QoS at
victim receivers through generating {\it intended} destructive interference.
While both user-assist and malicious RIS applications have been explored
extensively, the impact of RIS deployments on imposing {\it unintended}
interference on various wireless user-equipments (EUs) remains underexplored.
This paper investigates the challenges of integrating RISs into multi-carrier,
multi-user, and multi-operator networks. We discuss how RIS deployments
intended to benefit specific users can negatively impact other users served at
various carrier frequencies through different network operators. While not an
ideal solution, we discuss how ultra-narrowband metasurfaces can be
incorporated into the manufacturing of RISs to mitigate some challenges of RIS
deployment in wireless networks. We also present a simulation scenario to
illuminate some practical challenges associated with the deployment of RISs in
shared public environments.

                                        <span>  Forecasting accuracy in highly uncertain environments is challenging due to
the stochastic nature of systems. Deterministic forecasting provides only point
estimates and cannot capture potential outcomes. Therefore, probabilistic
forecasting has gained significant attention due to its ability to quantify
uncertainty, where one of the approaches is to express it as a prediction
interval (PI), that explicitly shows upper and lower bounds of predictions
associated with a confidence level. High-quality PI is characterized by a high
PI coverage probability (PICP) and a narrow PI width. In many real-world
applications, the PI width is generally used in risk management to prepare
resources that improve reliability and effectively manage uncertainty. A wider
PI width results in higher costs for backup resources as decision-making
processes often focus on the worst-case scenarios arising with large PI widths
under extreme conditions. This study aims to reduce the large PI width from the
PI estimation method by proposing a new PI loss function that penalizes the
average of the large PI widths more heavily. The proposed formulation is
compatible with gradient-based algorithms, the standard approach to training
neural networks (NNs), and integrating state-of-the-art NNs and existing deep
learning techniques. Experiments with the synthetic dataset reveal that our
formulation significantly reduces the large PI width while effectively
maintaining the PICP to achieve the desired probability. The practical
implementation of our proposed loss function is demonstrated in solar
irradiance forecasting, highlighting its effectiveness in minimizing the large
PI width in data with high uncertainty and showcasing its compatibility with
more complex neural network models. Therefore, reducing large PI widths from
our method can lead to significant cost savings by over-allocation of reserve
resources.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we provide a mathematical framework for improving
generalization in a class of learning problems which is related to point
estimations for modeling of high-dimensional nonlinear functions. In
particular, we consider a variational problem for a weakly-controlled gradient
system, whose control input enters into the system dynamics as a coefficient to
a nonlinear term which is scaled by a small parameter. Here, the optimization
problem consists of a cost functional, which is associated with how to gauge
the quality of the estimated model parameters at a certain fixed final time
w.r.t. the model validating dataset, while the weakly-controlled gradient
system, whose the time-evolution is guided by the model training dataset and
its perturbed version with small random noise. Using the perturbation theory,
we provide results that will allow us to solve a sequence of optimization
problems, i.e., a set of decomposed optimization problems, so as to aggregate
the corresponding approximate optimal solutions that are reasonably sufficient
for improving generalization in such a class of learning problems. Moreover, we
also provide an estimate for the rate of convergence for such approximate
optimal solutions. Finally, we present some numerical results for a typical
case of nonlinear regression problem.

processing, super-resolution, and computer vision, which are important areas in
image science. These application models can be seen as a three-function
composite optimization problem solvable by a variety of primal dual-type
methods. We propose a fair primal dual algorithmic framework that incorporates
the smooth term not only into the primal subproblem but also into the dual
subproblem. We unify the global convergence and establish the convergence rates
of our proposed fair primal dual method. Experiments on image denoising and
super-resolution reconstruction demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
method over the current state-of-the-art.

${\bf F}({\bf x})={\bf 0}$, where ${\bf F}:{\mathbb R}^{d}\to{\mathbb R}^d$. We
propose Gram-Reduced Levenberg--Marquardt method which updates the Gram matrix
${\bf J}(\cdot)^\top{\bf J}(\cdot)$ in every $m$ iterations, where ${\bf
J}(\cdot)$ is the Jacobian of ${\bf F}(\cdot)$. Our method has a global
convergence guarantee without relying on any step of line-search or solving
sub-problems. We prove our method takes at most
$\mathcal{O}(m^2+m^{-0.5}\epsilon^{-2.5})$ iterations to find an
$\epsilon$-stationary point of $\frac{1}{2}\|{\bf F}(\cdot)\|^2$, which leads
to overall computation cost of $\mathcal{O}(d^3\epsilon^{-1}+d^2\epsilon^{-2})$
by taking $m=\Theta(\epsilon^{-1})$. Our results are strictly better than the
cost of $\mathcal{O}(d^3\epsilon^{-2})$ for existing Levenberg--Marquardt
methods. We also show the proposed method enjoys local superlinear convergence
rate under the non-degenerate assumption. We provide experiments on real-world
applications in scientific computing and machine learning to validate the
efficiency of the proposed methods.

                                        <span>  Mesh generation has become a critical topic in recent years, forming the
foundation of all 3D objects used across various applications, such as virtual
reality, gaming, and 3D printing. With advancements in computational resources
and machine learning, neural networks have emerged as powerful tools for
generating high-quality 3D object representations, enabling accurate scene and
object reconstructions. Despite these advancements, many methods produce meshes
that lack realism or exhibit geometric and textural flaws, necessitating
additional processing to improve their quality. This research introduces a
convex optimization programming called disciplined convex programming to
enhance existing meshes by refining their texture and geometry with a conic
solver. By focusing on a sparse set of point clouds from both the original and
target meshes, this method demonstrates significant improvements in mesh
quality with minimal data requirements. To evaluate the approach, the classical
dolphin mesh dataset from Facebook AI was used as a case study, with
optimization performed using the CVXPY library. The results reveal promising
potential for streamlined and effective mesh refinement.

derive a uniqueness theorem for an inverse source problem related to the system

excitation and partial measurement when the network dynamics is linear on the
edges and nonlinear on the nodes. We assume that the graph topology and the
nonlinear functions at the node level are known, and we aim to identify the
weight matrix of the graph. Our main result is to prove that fully-connected
layered feed-forward networks are generically locally identifiable by exciting
sources and measuring sinks in the class of analytic functions that cross the
origin. This holds even when all other nodes remain unexcited and unmeasured
and stands in sharp contrast to most findings on network identifiability
requiring measurement and/or excitation of each node. The result applies in
particular to feed-forward artificial neural networks with no offsets and
generalizes previous literature by considering a broader class of functions and
topologies.

                                        <span>  Ill-posed configurations, such as collinear or coplanar point arrangements,
are a persistent challenge in computational geometry, complicating tasks as in
triangulation and convex hull construction. This paper discusses the
probability of such configurations arising in two scenarios: (1) data sampled
randomly from a uniform distribution, and (2) data collected from physical
systems, such as reflective surfaces or structured environments. We present a
probabilistic framework, analyze the geometric and sampling constraints, and
provide some mathematical insights into how data acquisition processes
influence the likelihood of degeneracies. Notably, our findings reveal that
degeneracies occur more frequently in physical systems than in purely random
simulations due to systematic biases introduced by instrumental setups and
environmental structures, emphasizing the risks of drawing conclusions solely
based on assumptions derived from random data.

activities of a repairable equipment with independent components. Most of the
existing works on optimal imperfect maintenance activities of a repairable
equipment with independent components. In addition, it is assumed that all the
components of the equipment share the same model and the same maintenance
intervals and that effectiveness of maintenance is known. In this paper we take
a different approach. In order to formalize the uncertainty on the occurrence
of failures and on the effect of maintenance activities we consider, for each
component, a class of candidate models obtained combining models for failure
rate with models for imperfect maintenance and let the data select the best
model (that might be different for the different components). All the
parameters are assumed to be unknown and are jointly estimated via maximum
likelihood. Model selection is performed, separately for each component, using
standard selection criteria that take into account the problem of
over-parametrization. The selected models are used to derive the cost per unit
time and the average reliability of the equipment, the objective functions of a
Multi-Objective Optimization Problem with maintenance intervals of each single
component as decision variables. The proposed procedure is illustrated using a
real data example.

                                        <span>  Districting is a complex combinatorial problem that consists in partitioning
a geographical area into small districts. In logistics, it is a major strategic
decision determining operating costs for several years. Solving districting
problems using traditional methods is intractable even for small geographical
areas and existing heuristics often provide sub-optimal results. We present a
structured learning approach to find high-quality solutions to real-world
districting problems in a few minutes. It is based on integrating a
combinatorial optimization layer, the capacitated minimum spanning tree
problem, into a graph neural network architecture. To train this pipeline in a
decision-aware fashion, we show how to construct target solutions embedded in a
suitable space and learn from target solutions. Experiments show that our
approach outperforms existing methods as it can significantly reduce costs on
real-world cities.

                                        <span>  Many optimization problems require hyperparameters, i.e., parameters that
must be pre-specified in advance, such as regularization parameters and
parametric regularizers in variational regularization methods for inverse
problems, and dictionaries in compressed sensing. A data-driven approach to
determine appropriate hyperparameter values is via a nested optimization
framework known as bilevel learning. Even when it is possible to employ a
gradient-based solver to the bilevel optimization problem, construction of the
gradients, known as hypergradients, is computationally challenging, each one
requiring both a solution of a minimization problem and a linear system solve.
These systems do not change much during the iterations, which motivates us to
apply recycling Krylov subspace methods, wherein information from one linear
system solve is re-used to solve the next linear system. Existing recycling
strategies often employ eigenvector approximations called Ritz vectors. In this
work we propose a novel recycling strategy based on a new concept, Ritz
generalized singular vectors, which acknowledge the bilevel setting.
Additionally, while existing iterative methods primarily terminate according to
the residual norm, this new concept allows us to define a new stopping
criterion that directly approximates the error of the associated hypergradient.
The proposed approach is validated through extensive numerical testing in the
context of an inverse problem in imaging.

problems such as planning and scheduling. A prominent method for solving MILPs
is large neighborhood search (LNS), which iteratively seeks improved solutions
within specific neighborhoods. Recent advancements have integrated machine
learning techniques into LNS to guide the construction of these neighborhoods
effectively. However, for large-scale MILPs, the search step in LNS becomes a
computational bottleneck, relying on off-the-shelf solvers to optimize
auxiliary MILPs of substantial size. To address this challenge, we introduce a
two-layer LNS (TLNS) approach that employs LNS to solve both the original MILP
and its auxiliary MILPs, necessitating the optimization of only small-sized
MILPs using off-the-shelf solvers. Additionally, we incorporate a lightweight
graph transformer model to inform neighborhood design. We conduct extensive
computational experiments using public benchmarks. The results indicate that
our learning-based TLNS approach achieves remarkable performance gains--up to
66% and 96% over LNS and state-of-the-art MILP solvers, respectively.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we develop a novel method for deriving a global optimal
control strategy for stochastic attitude kinematics on the special orthogonal
group SO(3). We first introduce a stochastic Lie-Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
(SL-HJB) equation on SO(3), which theoretically provides an optimality
condition for the global optimal control strategy of the stochastic attitude
kinematics. Then we propose a novel numerical method, the Successive
Wigner-Galerkin Approximation (SWGA) method, to solve the SL-HJB equation on
SO(3). The SWGA method leverages the Wigner-D functions to represent the
Galerkin solution of the SL-HJB equation in a policy iteration framework,
providing a computationally efficient approach to derive a global optimal
control strategy for systems on SO(3). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
SWGA method through numerical simulation on stochastic attitude stabilization.

                                        <span>  We present the first general stability results for nonlinear offset-free
model predictive control (MPC). Despite over twenty years of active research,
the offset-free MPC literature has not shaken the assumption of closed-loop
stability for establishing offset-free performance. In this paper, we present a
nonlinear offset-free MPC design that is robustly stable with respect to the
tracking errors, and thus achieves offset-free performance, despite plant-model
mismatch and persistent disturbances. Key features and assumptions of this
design include quadratic costs, differentiability of the plant and model
functions, constraint backoffs at steady state, and a robustly stable state and
disturbance estimator. We first establish nominal stability and offset-free
performance. Then, robustness to state and disturbance estimate errors and
setpoint and disturbance changes is demonstrated. Finally, the results are
extended to sufficiently small plant-model mismatch. The results are
illustrated by numerical examples.

an online algorithm must make repeated decisions to minimize both convex loss
functions and cumulative constraint violations. We focus on a setting where the
algorithm has access to predictions of the loss and constraint functions. Our
results show that we can improve the current best bounds of $ O(\sqrt{T}) $
regret and $ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative constraint violations to $
O(\sqrt{E_T(f)}) $ and $ \tilde{O}(\sqrt{E_T(g)}) $, respectively, where $

E_T(g) = O(T) $ (assuming bounded loss and constraint functions), our rates
match the prior $ O(\sqrt{T}) $ results. However, when the loss and constraint
predictions are accurate, our approach yields significantly smaller regret and
cumulative constraint violations. Notably, if the constraint function remains
constant over time, we achieve $ \tilde{O}(1) $ cumulative constraint
violation, aligning with prior results.

processing steps across different locations, rendering their operation
vulnerable to disruptions from unplanned events. Optimal responses should
consider factors such as product allocation, delayed shipments, and price
renegotiation , among other factors. In such context, we propose a multiperiod
mixed-integer linear programming model that integrates production, scheduling,
shipping, and order management to minimize the financial impact of such
disruptions. The model accommodates arbitrary supply chain topologies and
incorporates various disruption scenarios, offering adaptability to real-world
complexities. A case study from the chemical industry demonstrates the
scalability of the model under finer time discretization and explores the
influence of disruption types and order management costs on optimal schedules.
This approach provides a tractable, adaptable framework for developing
responsive operational plans in supply chain and manufacturing networks under
uncertainty.

                                        <span>  Classical optimization theory requires a small step-size for gradient-based
methods to converge. Nevertheless, recent findings challenge the traditional
idea by empirically demonstrating Gradient Descent (GD) converges even when the
step-size $\eta$ exceeds the threshold of $2/L$, where $L$ is the global smooth
constant. This is usually known as the Edge of Stability (EoS) phenomenon. A
widely held belief suggests that an objective function with subquadratic growth
plays an important role in incurring EoS. In this paper, we provide a more
comprehensive answer by considering the task of finding linear interpolator
$\beta \in R^{d}$ for regression with loss function $l(\cdot)$, where $\beta$
admits parameterization as $\beta = w^2_{+} - w^2_{-}$. Contrary to the
previous work that suggests a subquadratic $l$ is necessary for EoS, our novel
finding reveals that EoS occurs even when $l$ is quadratic under proper
conditions. This argument is made rigorous by both empirical and theoretical
evidence, demonstrating the GD trajectory converges to a linear interpolator in
a non-asymptotic way. Moreover, the model under quadratic $l$, also known as a
depth-$2$ diagonal linear network, remains largely unexplored under the EoS
regime. Our analysis then sheds some new light on the implicit bias of diagonal
linear networks when a larger step-size is employed, enriching the
understanding of EoS on more practical models.

                                        <span>  Support matrix machine (SMM) is a successful supervised classification model
for matrix-type samples. Unlike support vector machines, it employs low-rank
regularization on the regression matrix to effectively capture the intrinsic
structure embedded in each input matrix. When solving a large-scale SMM, a
major challenge arises from the potential increase in sample size, leading to
substantial computational and storage burdens. To address these issues, we
design a semismooth Newton-CG (SNCG) based augmented Lagrangian method (ALM)
for solving the SMM. The ALM exhibits an asymptotic R-superlinear convergence
if a strict complementarity condition is satisfied. The SNCG method is employed
to solve the ALM subproblems, achieving at least a superlinear convergence rate
under the nonemptiness of an index set. Furthermore, the sparsity of samples
and the low-rank nature of solutions enable us to reduce the computational cost
and storage demands for the Newton linear systems. Additionally, we develop an
adaptive sieving strategy that generates a solution path for the SMM by
exploiting sample sparsity. The finite convergence of this strategy is also
demonstrated. Numerical experiments on both large-scale real and synthetic
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

                                        <span>  This paper poses a theoretical characterization of the stochastic
reachability problem in terms of probability measures, capturing the
probability measure of the state of the system that satisfies the reachability
specification for all probabilities over a finite horizon. We achieve this by
constructing the level sets of the probability measure for all probability
values and, since our approach is only for autonomous systems, we can determine
the level sets via forward simulations of the system from a point in the state
space at some time step in the finite horizon to estimate the reach
probability. We devise a training procedure which exploits this forward
simulation and employ it to design a deep neural network (DNN) to predict the
reach probability provided the current state and time step. We validate the
effectiveness of our approach through three examples.

finite-horizon mean-field games. The proposed hybrid algorithm uses Markov
chain approximation method combined with a stochastic approximation-based
iterative deep learning algorithm. Under the framework of finite-horizon
mean-field games, the induced measure and Monte-Carlo algorithm are adopted to
establish the iterative mean-field interaction in Markov chain approximation
method and deep learning, respectively. The Markov chain approximation method
plays a key role in constructing the iterative algorithm and estimating an
initial value of a neural network, whereas stochastic approximation is used to
find accurate parameters in a bounded region. The convergence of the hybrid
algorithm is proved; two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the
results.

                                        <span>  Within the ViSE (Voting in Stochastic Environment) model, we study the
effectiveness of majority voting in various environments. By the pit of losses
paradox, majority decisions in apparently hostile environments systematically
reduce the capital of society. In such cases, the simple social decision rule
of ``rejecting all proposals without voting'' outperforms majority. In this
paper, we identify another pit of losses appearing in favorable environments.
Here, the simple social decision rule of ``accepting all proposals without
voting'' is superior to majority. We prove that under a version of simple
majority called symmetrized majority and the antisymmetry of the voting body,
the second pit of losses is a mirror image of the pit of losses in hostile
environments and explain this phenomenon. Technically, we consider a voting
society consisting of individualists whose strategy is supporting all proposals
that increase their capital and a group (groups) whose members vote to increase
the total group capital. According to the main result, the expected capital
gain of each agent in the environment whose generator $X$ has mean $\mu>0$
exceeds by $\mu$ their expected capital gain under generator $-X$. This result
extends to location families of generators with distributions symmetric about
their mean. The mentioned result determines the symmetry of the difference
between the expected capital gain under the symmetrized majority and that under
the ``basic'' social decision rule that rejects/accepts all proposals in
unfavorable/favorable environments.

                                        <span>  Kantorovich potentials denote the dual solutions of the renowned optimal
transportation problem. Uniqueness of these solutions is relevant from both a
theoretical and an algorithmic point of view, and has recently emerged as a
necessary condition for asymptotic results in the context of statistical and
entropic optimal transport. In this work, we challenge the common perception
that uniqueness in continuous settings is reliant on the connectedness of the
support of at least one of the involved measures, and we provide mild
sufficient conditions for uniqueness even when both measures have disconnected
support. Since our main finding builds upon the uniqueness of Kantorovich
potentials on connected components, we revisit the corresponding arguments and
provide generalizations of well-known results. To this end, we introduce the
notion of induced regularity and employ it to extend the regularity theory of
Kantorovich potentials advanced by Gangbo and McCann (1996) to more general
cost functions in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and to geodesic spaces.

                                        <span>  Incomplete LU factorizations of sparse matrices are widely used as
preconditioners in Krylov subspace methods to speed up solving linear systems.
Unfortunately, computing the preconditioner itself can be time-consuming and
sensitive to hyper-parameters. Instead, we replace the hand-engineered
algorithm with a graph neural network that is trained to approximate the matrix
factorization directly. To apply the output of the neural network as a
preconditioner, we propose an output activation function that guarantees that
the predicted factorization is invertible. Further, applying a graph neural
network architecture allows us to ensure that the output itself is sparse which
is desirable from a computational standpoint. We theoretically analyze and
empirically evaluate different loss functions to train the learned
preconditioners and show their effectiveness in decreasing the number of GMRES
iterations and improving the spectral properties on synthetic data. The code is
available at https://github.com/paulhausner/neural-incomplete-factorization.

                                        <span>  Optimization problems involving mixed variables (i.e., variables of numerical
and categorical nature) can be challenging to solve, especially in the presence
of mixed-variable constraints. Moreover, when the objective function is the
result of a complicated simulation or experiment, it may be
expensive-to-evaluate. This paper proposes a novel surrogate-based global
optimization algorithm to solve linearly constrained mixed-variable problems up
to medium size (around 100 variables after encoding). The proposed approach is
based on constructing a piecewise affine surrogate of the objective function
over feasible samples. We assume the objective function is black-box and
expensive-to-evaluate, while the linear constraints are quantifiable,
unrelaxable, a priori known, and are cheap to evaluate. We introduce two types
of exploration functions to efficiently search the feasible domain via
mixed-integer linear programming solvers. We also provide a preference-based
version of the algorithm designed for situations where only pairwise
comparisons between samples can be acquired, while the underlying objective
function to minimize remains unquantified. The two algorithms are evaluated on
several unconstrained and constrained mixed-variable benchmark problems. The
results show that, within a small number of required experiments/simulations,
the proposed algorithms can often achieve better or comparable results than
other existing methods.

                                        <span>  In this work we study the behavior of the forward-backward (FB) algorithm
when the proximity operator is replaced by a sub-iterative procedure to
approximate a Gaussian denoiser, in a Plug-and-Play (PnP) fashion. In
particular, we consider both analysis and synthesis Gaussian denoisers within a
dictionary framework, obtained by unrolling dual-FB iterations or FB
iterations, respectively. We analyze the associated minimization problems as
well as the asymptotic behavior of the resulting FB-PnP iterations. In
particular, we show that the synthesis Gaussian denoising problem can be viewed
as a proximity operator. For each case, analysis and synthesis, we show that
the FB-PnP algorithms solve the same problem whether we use only one or an
infinite number of sub-iteration to solve the denoising problem at each
iteration. To this aim, we show that each "one sub-iteration" strategy within
the FB-PnP can be interpreted as a primal-dual algorithm when a warm-restart
strategy is used. We further present similar results when using a Moreau-Yosida
smoothing of the global problem, for an arbitrary number of sub-iterations.
Finally, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical
results. In particular we first consider a toy compressive sensing example, as
well as an image restoration problem in a deep dictionary framework.

                                        <span>  We study a large-scale patrol problem with state-dependent costs and
multi-agent coordination.We consider heterogeneous agents, rather general
reward functions, and the capabilities of tracking agents' trajectories.Given
the complexity and uncertainty of the practical situations for patrolling, we
model the problem as a discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP) that
consists of a large number of parallel stochastic processes.We aim to minimize
the cumulative patrolling cost over a finite time horizon. The problem exhibits
an excessively large size of state space, which increases exponentially in the
number of agents and the size of geographical region for patrolling. To reach
practical solutions, we relax the dependencies between these parallel
stochastic processes by randomizing all the state and action variables. In this
context, the entire problem can be decomposed into a number of sub-problems,
each of which has a much smaller state space and can be solved independently.
The solutions of these sub-problems can lead to efficient heuristics. Unlike
the past systems assuming relatively simple structure of the underlying
stochastic process, here, tracking the patrol trajectories involves strong
dependencies between the stochastic processes, leading to entirely different
state and action spaces, transition kernels, and behaviours of processes,
rendering the existing methods inapplicable or impractical. Further more, we
prove that the performance deviation between the proposed policies and the
possible optimal solution diminishes exponentially in the problem size, which
also establishes the fact that the policies converge asymptotically at an
exponential rate.

state-feedback control policies take the form of a probability distribution and
where a penalty on the entropy is added. By viewing the cost function as a
Kullback- Leibler (KL) divergence between two joint distributions, we bring the
tools from variational inference to bear on our optimal control problem. This
allows for deriving a dynamic programming principle, where the value function
is defined as a KL divergence again. We then resort to Gaussian distributions
to approximate the control policies and apply the theory to control affine
nonlinear systems with quadratic costs. This results in closed-form recursive
updates, which generalize LQR control and the backward Riccati equation. We
illustrate this novel method on the simple problem of stabilizing an inverted
pendulum.

the work of Attouch, Goudou, and Redont which deals with finite time horizons.
In other words, this work studies the asymptotic behavior of a ball rolling on

                                        <span>  Variational inequalities (VIs) are a broad class of optimization problems
encompassing machine learning problems ranging from standard convex
minimization to more complex scenarios like min-max optimization and computing
the equilibria of multi-player games. In convex optimization, strong convexity
allows for fast statistical learning rates requiring only $\Theta(1/\epsilon)$
stochastic first-order oracle calls to find an $\epsilon$-optimal solution,
rather than the standard $\Theta(1/\epsilon^2)$ calls. In this paper, we
explain how one can similarly obtain fast $\Theta(1/\epsilon)$ rates for
learning VIs that satisfy strong monotonicity, a generalization of strong
convexity. Specifically, we demonstrate that standard stability-based
generalization arguments for convex minimization extend directly to VIs when
the domain admits a small covering, or when the operator is integrable and
suboptimality is measured by potential functions; such as when finding
equilibria in multi-player games.

                                        <span>  Soft grippers have demonstrated a strong ability to successfully pick and
manipulate many objects. A key limitation to their wider adoption is their
inability to grasp larger payloads due to objects slipping out of grasps. We
have overcome this limitation by introducing a torsionally rigid strain
limiting layer (TR-SLL). This reduces out-of-plane bending while maintaining
the gripper's softness and in-plane flexibility. We characterize the design
space of the strain limiting layer and Handed Shearing Auxetic (HSA) actuators
for a soft gripper using simulation and experiment. The inclusion of the TR-SLL
with HSAs enables HSA grippers to be made with a single digit. We found that
the use of our TR-SLL HSA gripper enabled pinch grasping of payloads over 1 kg.
We demonstrate a lifting capacity of 5 kg when loading using the TR-SLL. We
also demonstrate a peak pinch grasp force of 5.8 N, and a peak planar caging
force of 14.5 N. Finally, we test the TR-SLL gripper on a suite of 43 YCB
objects. We show success on 37 objects demonstrating significant capabilities.

                                        <span>  Partial-assistance exoskeletons hold significant potential for gait
rehabilitation by promoting active participation during (re)learning of
normative walking patterns. Typically, the control of interaction torques in
partial-assistance exoskeletons relies on a hierarchical control structure.
These approaches require extensive calibration due to the complexity of the
controller and user-specific parameter tuning, especially for activities like
stair or ramp navigation. To address the limitations of hierarchical control in
exoskeletons, this work proposes a three-step, data-driven approach: (1) using
recent sensor data to probabilistically infer locomotion states (landing step
length, landing step height, walking velocity, step clearance, gait phase), (2)
allowing therapists to modify these features via a user interface, and (3)
using the adjusted locomotion features to predict the desired joint posture and
model stiffness in a spring-damper system based on prediction uncertainty. We
evaluated the proposed approach with two healthy participants engaging in
treadmill walking and stair ascent and descent at varying speeds, with and
without external modification of the gait features through a user interface.
Results showed a variation in kinematics according to the gait characteristics
and a negative interaction power suggesting exoskeleton assistance across the
different conditions.

                                        <span>  Intent inferral, the process by which a robotic device predicts a user's
intent from biosignals, offers an effective and intuitive way to control
wearable robots. Classical intent inferral methods treat biosignal inputs as
unidirectional ground truths for training machine learning models, where the
internal state of the model is not directly observable by the user. In this
work, we propose reciprocal learning, a bidirectional paradigm that facilitates
human adaptation to an intent inferral classifier. Our paradigm consists of
iterative, interwoven stages that alternate between updating machine learning
models and guiding human adaptation with the use of augmented visual feedback.
We demonstrate this paradigm in the context of controlling a robotic hand
orthosis for stroke, where the device predicts open, close, and relax intents
from electromyographic (EMG) signals and provides appropriate assistance. We
use LED progress-bar displays to communicate to the user the predicted
probabilities for open and close intents by the classifier. Our experiments
with stroke subjects show reciprocal learning improving performance in a subset
of subjects (two out of five) without negatively impacting performance on the
others. We hypothesize that, during reciprocal learning, subjects can learn to
reproduce more distinguishable muscle activation patterns and generate more
separable biosignals.

essential for several urban understanding tasks such as reconstruction,
navigation, and mapping. Despite significant progress in the area, extracting
accurate polygonal building footprints remains an open problem. In this paper,
we introduce Pix2Poly, an attention-based end-to-end trainable and
differentiable deep neural network capable of directly generating explicit
high-quality building footprints in a ring graph format. Pix2Poly employs a
generative encoder-decoder transformer to produce a sequence of graph vertex
tokens whose connectivity information is learned by an optimal matching
network. Compared to previous graph learning methods, ours is a truly
end-to-end trainable approach that extracts high-quality building footprints
and road networks without requiring complicated, computationally intensive
raster loss functions and intricate training pipelines. Upon evaluating
Pix2Poly on several complex and challenging datasets, we report that Pix2Poly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in several vector shape quality metrics
while being an entirely explicit method. Our code is available at

end-effector of a redundant robot manipulator to traverse a Cartesian path by
optimizing the trajectory of its joints. Each joint has limits in the ranges of
position, velocity and acceleration, the latter making jerks in joint space
undesirable. The proposed approach takes this nonlinear optimization problem
whose variables are path speed and joint trajectory and reformulates it into a
bi-level problem. The lower-level formulation is a convex subproblem that
considers a fixed joint trajectory and maximizes path speed while considering
all joint velocity and acceleration constraints. Under particular conditions,
this subproblem has a closed-form solution. Then, we solve a higher-level
subproblem by leveraging the directional derivative of the lower-level value
with respect to the joint trajectory parameters. In particular, we use this
direction to implement a Primal-Dual method that considers the path accuracy
and joint position constraints. We show the efficacy of our proposed approach
with simulations and experimental results.

upper-body manipulation. While recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches
provide whole-body loco-manipulation policies, they lack precise manipulation
with high DoF arms. In this paper, we propose decoupling upper-body control
from locomotion, using inverse kinematics (IK) and motion retargeting for
precise manipulation, while RL focuses on robust lower-body locomotion. We
introduce PMP (Predictive Motion Priors), trained with Conditional Variational
Autoencoder (CVAE) to effectively represent upper-body motions. The locomotion
policy is trained conditioned on this upper-body motion representation,
ensuring that the system remains robust with both manipulation and locomotion.
We show that CVAE features are crucial for stability and robustness, and
significantly outperforms RL-based whole-body control in precise manipulation.
With precise upper-body motion and robust lower-body locomotion control,
operators can remotely control the humanoid to walk around and explore
different environments, while performing diverse manipulation tasks.

challenges due to its lack of structure, making it difficult to handcraft
robust heuristics for diverse scenarios. While learned methods using hand
labels or self-supervised data improve generalizability, they often require a
tremendous amount of data and can be vulnerable to domain shifts. To improve
generalization in novel environments, recent works have incorporated adaptation
and self-supervision to develop autonomous systems that can learn from their
own experiences online. However, current works often rely on significant prior
data, for example minutes of human teleoperation data for each terrain type,
which is difficult to scale with more environments and robots. To address these
limitations, we propose SALON, a perception-action framework for fast
adaptation of traversability estimates with minimal human input. SALON rapidly
learns online from experience while avoiding out of distribution terrains to
produce adaptive and risk-aware cost and speed maps. Within seconds of
collected experience, our results demonstrate comparable navigation performance
over kilometer-scale courses in diverse off-road terrain as methods trained on
100-1000x more data. We additionally show promising results on significantly
different robots in different environments. Our code is available at

studies highlight that large multimodal language models (MLMs) struggle to
reason about space, they only test for static spatial reasoning, such as
categorizing the relative positions of objects. Meanwhile, real-world

action recognition. As a roadmap to improving spatial intelligence, we
introduce SAT, Spatial Aptitude Training, which goes beyond static relative
object position questions to the more dynamic tasks. SAT contains 218K

arbitrarily scaled and easily extended to new actions, scenes, and 3D assets.
We find that even MLMs that perform relatively well on static questions
struggle to accurately answer dynamic spatial questions. Further, we show that
SAT instruction-tuning data improves not only dynamic spatial reasoning on SAT,
but also zero-shot performance on existing real-image spatial benchmarks:
$23\%$ on CVBench, $8\%$ on the harder BLINK benchmark, and $18\%$ on VSR. When
instruction-tuned on SAT, our 13B model matches larger proprietary MLMs like
GPT4-V and Gemini-3-1.0 in spatial reasoning. Our data/code is available at

                                        <span>  Emerging 3D geometric foundation models, such as DUSt3R, offer a promising
approach for in-the-wild 3D vision tasks. However, due to the high-dimensional
nature of the problem space and scarcity of high-quality 3D data, these
pre-trained models still struggle to generalize to many challenging
circumstances, such as limited view overlap or low lighting. To address this,
we propose LoRA3D, an efficient self-calibration pipeline to
$\textit{specialize}$ the pre-trained models to target scenes using their own
multi-view predictions. Taking sparse RGB images as input, we leverage robust
optimization techniques to refine multi-view predictions and align them into a
global coordinate frame. In particular, we incorporate prediction confidence
into the geometric optimization process, automatically re-weighting the
confidence to better reflect point estimation accuracy. We use the calibrated
confidence to generate high-quality pseudo labels for the calibrating views and
use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the models on the pseudo-labeled
data. Our method does not require any external priors or manual labels. It
completes the self-calibration process on a $\textbf{single standard GPU within
just 5 minutes}$. Each low-rank adapter requires only $\textbf{18MB}$ of
storage. We evaluated our method on $\textbf{more than 160 scenes}$ from the
Replica, TUM and Waymo Open datasets, achieving up to $\textbf{88% performance
improvement}$ on 3D reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation and novel-view
rendering.

                                        <span>  Accurate estimation of a user's biological joint moment from wearable sensor
data is vital for improving exoskeleton control during real-world locomotor
tasks. However, most state-of-the-art methods rely on deep learning techniques
that necessitate extensive in-lab data collection, posing challenges in
acquiring sufficient data to develop robust models. To address this challenge,
we introduce a locomotor task set optimization strategy designed to identify a
minimal, yet representative, set of tasks that preserves model performance
while significantly reducing the data collection burden. In this optimization,
we performed a cluster analysis on the dimensionally reduced biomechanical
features of various cyclic and non-cyclic tasks. We identified the minimal
viable clusters (i.e., tasks) to train a neural network for estimating hip
joint moments and evaluated its performance. Our cross-validation analysis
across subjects showed that the optimized task set-based model achieved a root
mean squared error of 0.30$\pm$0.05 Nm/kg. This performance was significantly
better than using only cyclic tasks (p<0.05) and was comparable to using the
full set of tasks. Our results demonstrate the ability to maintain model
accuracy while significantly reducing the cost associated with data collection
and model training. This highlights the potential for future exoskeleton
designers to leverage this strategy to minimize the data requirements for deep
learning-based models in wearable robot control.

current observations to maximize cumulative future rewards. In real-world
applications (i.e., non-simulated environments), sensors are essential for
measuring the current state and providing the observations on which RL policies
rely to make decisions. A significant challenge in deploying RL policies in
real-world scenarios is handling sensor dropouts, which can result from
hardware malfunctions, physical damage, or environmental factors like dust on a
camera lens. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is the use of backup
sensors, though this comes with added costs. This paper explores the
optimization of backup sensor configurations to maximize expected returns while
keeping costs below a specified threshold, C. Our approach uses a second-order
approximation of expected returns and includes penalties for exceeding cost
constraints. We then optimize this quadratic program using Tabu Search, a
meta-heuristic algorithm. The approach is evaluated across eight OpenAI Gym
environments and a custom Unity-based robotic environment (RobotArmGrasping).
Empirical results demonstrate that our quadratic program effectively
approximates real expected returns, facilitating the identification of optimal
sensor configurations.

significant important role in the new round of world revolution. Further,
mobile robots might assist or replace human beings in a great number of areas.
To increase the degree of automation for mobile robots, advanced motion
planners need to be integrated into them to cope with various environments.
Complex maze environments are common in the potential application scenarios of
different mobile robots. This article proposes a novel motion planner named the
rapidly exploring random tree based Gaussian process motion planner 2, which
aims to tackle the motion planning problem for mobile robots in complex maze
environments. To be more specific, the proposed motion planner successfully
combines the advantages of a trajectory optimisation motion planning algorithm
named the Gaussian process motion planner 2 and a sampling-based motion
planning algorithm named the rapidly exploring random tree. To validate the
performance and practicability of the proposed motion planner, we have tested
it in several simulations in the Matrix laboratory and applied it on a marine
mobile robot in a virtual scenario in the Robotic operating system.

variety of maritime applications such as the exploration of unknown areas,
autonomous transportation, offshore patrol and others. In such maritime
applications, unmanned surface vehicles executing relevant missions that might
collide with potential static obstacles such as islands and reefs and dynamic
obstacles such as other moving unmanned surface vehicles. To successfully
accomplish these missions, motion planning algorithms that can generate smooth
and collision-free trajectories to avoid both these static and dynamic
obstacles in an efficient manner are essential. In this article, we propose a
novel motion planning algorithm named the Dynamic Gaussian process motion
planner 2, which successfully extends the application scope of the Gaussian
process motion planner 2 into complex and dynamic environments with both static
and dynamic obstacles. First, we introduce an approach to generate safe areas
for dynamic obstacles using modified multivariate Gaussian distributions.
Second, we introduce an approach to integrate real-time status information of
dynamic obstacles into the modified multivariate Gaussian distributions.
Therefore, the multivariate Gaussian distributions with real-time statuses of
dynamic obstacles can be innovatively added into the optimisation process of
factor graph to generate an optimised trajectory. The proposed Dynamic Gaussian
process motion planner 2 algorithm has been validated in a series of benchmark
simulations in the Matrix laboratory and a dynamic obstacle avoidance mission
in a high-fidelity maritime environment in the Robotic operating system to
demonstrate its functionality and practicability.

difficult. Synthetic data generation techniques for DNN allow for the easy
exploration of diverse scenarios. However, synthetic data generation solutions
for aerial vehicles are still lacking.
  This work presents a data augmentation framework for aerial vehicle's
perception training, leveraging photorealistic simulation integrated with
high-fidelity vehicle dynamics. Safe landing is a crucial challenge in the
development of autonomous air taxis, therefore, landing maneuver is chosen as
the focus of this work. With repeated simulations of landing in varying
scenarios we assess the landing performance of the VTOL type UAV and gather
valuable data. The landing performance is used as the objective function to
optimize the DNN through retraining. Given the high computational cost of DNN
retraining, we incorporated Bayesian Optimization in our framework that
systematically explores the data augmentation parameter space to retrain the
best-performing models. The framework allowed us to identify high-performing
data augmentation parameters that are consistently effective across different
landing scenarios. Utilizing the capabilities of this data augmentation
framework, we obtained a robust perception model. The model consistently
improved the perception-based landing success rate by at least 20% under
different lighting and weather conditions.

                                        <span>  This paper addresses the trajectory planning problem for automated vehicle
on-ramp highway merging. To tackle this challenge, we extend our previous work
on trajectory planning at unsignalized intersections using Partially Observable
Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief
Tree (ABT) algorithm, an approximate sampling-based approach to solve POMDPs
efficiently. We outline the POMDP formulation process, beginning with
discretizing the highway topology to reduce problem complexity. Additionally,
we describe the dynamics and measurement models used to predict future states
and establish the relationship between available noisy measurements and
predictions. Building on our previous work, the dynamics model is expanded to
account for lateral movements necessary for lane changes during the merging
process. We also define the reward function, which serves as the primary
mechanism for specifying the desired behavior of the automated vehicle,
combining multiple goals such as avoiding collisions or maintaining appropriate
velocity. Our simulation results, conducted on three scenarios based on
real-life traffic data from German highways, demonstrate the method's ability
to generate safe, collision-free, and efficient merging trajectories. This work
shows the versatility of this POMDP-based approach in tackling various
automated driving problems.

the unpredictability introduced by common manufacturing processes such as 3D
printing and molding. These processes often result in deviations from simulated
designs, requiring multiple prototypes before achieving a functional system. In
this study, we propose a novel methodology to address these limitations by
combining advanced rapid prototyping techniques and an efficient optimization
strategy. Firstly, we employ rapid prototyping methods typically used for rigid
structures, leveraging their precision to fabricate compliant components with
reduced manufacturing errors. Secondly, our optimization framework minimizes
the need for extensive prototyping, significantly reducing the iterative design
process. The methodology enables the identification of stiffness parameters
that are more practical and achievable within current manufacturing
capabilities. The proposed approach demonstrates a substantial improvement in
the efficiency of prototype development while maintaining the desired
performance characteristics. This work represents a step forward in bridging
the sim-to-real gap in soft robotics, paving the way towards a faster and more
reliable deployment of soft robotic systems.

behavior, but it is prone to unreliable outcomes in out-of-sample (OOS)
regions. While previous research relying on stable dynamical systems guarantees
convergence to a desired state, it often overlooks transient behavior. We
propose a framework for learning policies using modeled by contractive
dynamical systems, ensuring that all policy rollouts converge regardless of
perturbations, and in turn, enable efficient OOS recovery. By leveraging
recurrent equilibrium networks and coupling layers, the policy structure
guarantees contractivity for any parameter choice, which facilitates
unconstrained optimization. Furthermore, we provide theoretical upper bounds
for worst-case and expected loss terms, rigorously establishing the reliability
of our method in deployment. Empirically, we demonstrate substantial OOS
performance improvements in robotics manipulation and navigation tasks in
simulation.

                                        <span>  LiDAR is widely used in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and
autonomous driving. The LiDAR odometry is of great importance in multi-sensor
fusion. However, in some unstructured environments, the point cloud
registration cannot constrain the poses of the LiDAR due to its sparse
geometric features, which leads to the degeneracy of multi-sensor fusion
accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel real-time approach to
sense and compensate for the degeneracy of LiDAR. Firstly, this paper
introduces the degeneracy factor with clear meaning, which can measure the
degeneracy of LiDAR. Then, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications
with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering method adaptively perceives the degeneracy with
better environmental generalization. Finally, the degeneracy perception results
are utilized to fuse LiDAR and IMU, thus effectively resisting degeneracy
effects. Experiments on our dataset show the method's high accuracy and
robustness and validate our algorithm's adaptability to different environments
and LiDAR scanning modalities.

efficient Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) approaches, which combine high-level
symbolic plan with low-level motion planning. Advances in Large Language Models
(LLMs), such as GPT-4, are transforming task planning by offering natural
language as an intuitive and flexible way to describe tasks, generate symbolic
plans, and reason. However, the effectiveness of LLM-based TAMP approaches is
limited due to static and template-based prompting, which struggles in adapting
to dynamic environments and complex task contexts. To address these
limitations, this work proposes a novel ontology-driven prompt-tuning framework
that employs knowledge-based reasoning to refine and expand user prompts with
task contextual reasoning and knowledge-based environment state descriptions.
Integrating domain-specific knowledge into the prompt ensures semantically
accurate and context-aware task plans. The proposed framework demonstrates its
effectiveness by resolving semantic errors in symbolic plan generation, such as
maintaining logical temporal goal ordering in scenarios involving hierarchical
object placement. The proposed framework is validated through both simulation
and real-world scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements over the
baseline approach in terms of adaptability to dynamic environments, and the
generation of semantically correct task plans.

grasp in human-to-robot handovers. However, relying on hand-crafted prior
knowledge about the geometric structure of the object fails when generalising
to unseen objects, and depth sensors fail to detect transparent objects such as
drinking glasses. In this work, we propose a stereo-based method for
hand-object reconstruction that combines single-view reconstructions
probabilistically to form a coherent stereo reconstruction. We learn 3D shape
priors from a large synthetic hand-object dataset to ensure that our method is
generalisable, and use RGB inputs instead of depth as RGB can better capture
transparent objects. We show that our method achieves a lower object Chamfer
distance compared to existing RGB based hand-object reconstruction methods on
single view and stereo settings. We process the reconstructed hand-object shape
with a projection-based outlier removal step and use the output to guide a
human-to-robot handover pipeline with wide-baseline stereo RGB cameras. Our
hand-object reconstruction enables a robot to successfully receive a diverse
range of household objects from the human.

                                        <span>  In the autonomous vehicle and self-driving paradigm, cooperative perception
or exchanging sensor information among vehicles over wireless communication has
added a new dimension. Generally, an autonomous vehicle is a special type of
robot that requires real-time, highly reliable sensor inputs due to functional
safety. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with a considerable number of sensors
to provide different required sensor data to make the driving decision and
share with other surrounding vehicles. The inclusion of Data Distribution
Service(DDS) as a communication middleware in ROS2 has proved its potential
capability to be a reliable real-time distributed system. DDS comes with a
scoping mechanism known as domain. Whenever a ROS2 process is initiated, it
creates a DDS participant. It is important to note that there is a limit to the
number of participants allowed in a single domain.
  The efficient handling of numerous in-vehicle sensors and their messages
demands the use of multiple ROS2 nodes in a single vehicle. Additionally, in
the cooperative perception paradigm, a significant number of ROS2 nodes can be
required when a vehicle functions as a single ROS2 node. These ROS2 nodes
cannot be part of a single domain due to DDS participant limitation; thus,
different domain communication is unavoidable. Moreover, there are different
vendor-specific implementations of DDS, and each vendor has their
configurations, which is an inevitable communication catalyst between the ROS2
nodes. The communication between vehicles or robots or ROS2 nodes depends
directly on the vendor-specific configuration, data type, data size, and the
DDS implementation used as middleware; in our study, we evaluate and
investigate the limitations, capabilities, and prospects of the different
domain communication for various vendor-specific DDS implementations for
diverse sensor data type.

                                        <span>  In earthwork and construction, excavators often encounter large rocks mixed
with various soil conditions, requiring skilled operators. This paper presents
a framework for achieving autonomous excavation using reinforcement learning
(RL) through a rock excavation simulator. In the simulation, resolution can be
defined by the particle size/number in the whole soil space. Fine-resolution
simulations closely mimic real-world behavior but demand significant
calculation time and challenging sample collection, while coarse-resolution
simulations enable faster sample collection but deviate from real-world
behavior. To combine the advantages of both resolutions, we explore using
policies developed in coarse-resolution simulations for pre-training in
fine-resolution simulations. To this end, we propose a novel policy learning
framework called Progressive-Resolution Policy Distillation (PRPD), which
progressively transfers policies through some middle-resolution simulations
with conservative policy transfer to avoid domain gaps that could lead to
policy transfer failure. Validation in a rock excavation simulator and nine
real-world rock environments demonstrated that PRPD reduced sampling time to
less than 1/7 while maintaining task success rates comparable to those achieved
through policy learning in a fine-resolution simulation.

                                        <span>  Vision-based target tracking is crucial for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)
to perform tasks such as inspection, monitoring, and surveillance. However,
real-time tracking in complex maritime environments is challenging due to
dynamic camera movement, low visibility, and scale variation. Typically, object
detection methods combined with filtering techniques are commonly used for
tracking, but they often lack robustness, particularly in the presence of
camera motion and missed detections. Although advanced tracking methods have
been proposed recently, their application in maritime scenarios is limited. To
address this gap, this study proposes a vision-guided object-tracking framework
for USVs, integrating state-of-the-art tracking algorithms with low-level
control systems to enable precise tracking in dynamic maritime environments. We
benchmarked the performance of seven distinct trackers, developed using
advanced deep learning techniques such as Siamese Networks and Transformers, by
evaluating them on both simulated and real-world maritime datasets. In
addition, we evaluated the robustness of various control algorithms in
conjunction with these tracking systems. The proposed framework was validated
through simulations and real-world sea experiments, demonstrating its
effectiveness in handling dynamic maritime conditions. The results show that
SeqTrack, a Transformer-based tracker, performed best in adverse conditions,
such as dust storms. Among the control algorithms evaluated, the linear
quadratic regulator controller (LQR) demonstrated the most robust and smooth
control, allowing for stable tracking of the USV.

Predictive Control (MPC) for agile landing of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
onto an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV)'s deck in harsh conditions. The
trajectory generation exploits the state predictions of the USV to create
periodically updated trajectories for a multirotor UAV to precisely land on the
deck of a moving USV even in cases where the deck's inclination is continuously
changing. We use an MPC-based scheme to create trajectories that consider both
the UAV dynamics and the predicted states of the USV up to the first derivative
of position and orientation. Compared to existing approaches, our method
dynamically modifies the penalization matrices to precisely follow the
corresponding states with respect to the flight phase. Especially during the
landing maneuver, the UAV synchronizes attitude with the USV's, allowing for
fast landing on a tilted deck. Simulations show the method's reliability in
various sea conditions up to Rough sea (wave height 4 m), outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in landing speed and accuracy, with twice the
precision on average. Finally, real-world experiments validate the simulation
results, demonstrating robust landings on a moving USV, while all computations
are performed in real-time onboard the UAV.

of 3D articulated objects. Troubled by flexibility-quality tradeoffs, existing
methods are often limited to using predefined structures or retrieving shapes
from static datasets. To address these challenges, we parameterize an
articulated object as a tree of tokens and employ a transformer to generate
both the object's high-level geometry code and its kinematic relations.
Subsequently, each sub-part's geometry is further decoded using a
signed-distance-function (SDF) shape prior, facilitating the synthesis of
high-quality 3D shapes. Our approach enables the generation of diverse objects
with high-quality geometry and varying number of parts. Comprehensive
experiments on conditional generation from text descriptions demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of our method.

                                        <span>  In recent years, robotics has advanced significantly through the integration
of larger models and large-scale datasets. However, challenges remain in
applying these models to 3D spatial interactions and managing data collection
costs. To address these issues, we propose the multimodal robotic manipulation
model, RoboMM, along with the comprehensive dataset, RoboData. RoboMM enhances
3D perception through camera parameters and occupancy supervision. Building on
OpenFlamingo, it incorporates Modality-Isolation-Mask and multimodal decoder
blocks, improving modality fusion and fine-grained perception. RoboData offers
the complete evaluation system by integrating several well-known datasets,
achieving the first fusion of multi-view images, camera parameters, depth maps,
and actions, and the space alignment facilitates comprehensive learning from
diverse robotic datasets. Equipped with RoboData and the unified physical
space, RoboMM is the generalist policy that enables simultaneous evaluation
across all tasks within multiple datasets, rather than focusing on limited
selection of data or tasks. Its design significantly enhances robotic
manipulation performance, increasing the average sequence length on the CALVIN
from 1.7 to 3.3 and ensuring cross-embodiment capabilities, achieving
state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets.

                                        <span>  Structural health monitoring (SHM) is essential for the early detection of
infrastructure defects, such as cracks in concrete bridge pier. but often faces
challenges in efficiency and accuracy in complex environments. Although the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) achieves excellent segmentation performance, its
computational demands limit its suitability for real-time applications on edge
devices. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Crack-EdgeSAM, a
self-prompting crack segmentation system that integrates YOLOv8 for generating
prompt boxes and a fine-tuned EdgeSAM model for crack segmentation. To ensure
computational efficiency, the method employs ConvLoRA, a Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) technique, along with DiceFocalLoss to fine-tune the EdgeSAM
model. Our experimental results on public datasets and the climbing robot
automatic inspections demonstrate that the system achieves high segmentation
accuracy and significantly enhanced inference speed compared to the most recent
methods. Notably, the system processes 1024 x 1024 pixels images at 46 FPS on
our PC and 8 FPS on Jetson Orin Nano.

                                        <span>  Tractor-trailer wheeled robots need to perform comprehensive perception tasks
to enhance their operations in areas such as logistics parks and long-haul
transportation. The perception of these robots face three major challenges: the
relative pose change between the tractor and trailer, the asynchronous
vibrations between the tractor and trailer, and the significant camera parallax
caused by the large size. In this paper, we propose a novel Unified Vertex
Motion Video Stabilization and Stitching framework designed for unknown
environments. To establish the relationship between stabilization and
stitching, the proposed Unified Vertex Motion framework comprises the Stitching
Motion Field, which addresses relative positional change, and the Stabilization
Motion Field, which tackles asynchronous vibrations. Then, recognizing the
heterogeneity of optimization functions required for stabilization and
stitching, a weighted cost function approach is proposed to address the problem
of camera parallax. Furthermore, this framework has been successfully
implemented in real tractor-trailer wheeled robots. The proposed Unified Vertex
Motion Video Stabilization and Stitching method has been thoroughly tested in
various challenging scenarios, demonstrating its accuracy and practicality in
real-world robot tasks.

                                        <span>  The anthropomorphism of grasping process significantly benefits the
experience and grasping efficiency of prosthetic hand wearers. Currently,
prosthetic hands controlled by signals such as brain-computer interfaces (BCI)
and electromyography (EMG) face difficulties in precisely recognizing the
amputees' grasping gestures and executing anthropomorphic grasp processes.
Although prosthetic hands equipped with vision systems enables the objects'
feature recognition, they lack perception of human grasping intention.
Therefore, this paper explores the estimation of grasping gestures solely
through visual data to accomplish anthropopathic grasping control and the
determination of grasping intention within a multi-object environment. To
address this, we propose the Spatial Geometry-based Gesture Mapping (SG-GM)
method, which constructs gesture functions based on the geometric features of
the human hand grasping processes. It's subsequently implemented on the
prosthetic hand. Furthermore, we propose the Motion Trajectory Regression-based
Grasping Intent Estimation (MTR-GIE) algorithm. This algorithm predicts
pre-grasping object utilizing regression prediction and prior spatial
segmentation estimation derived from the prosthetic hand's position and
trajectory. The experiments were conducted to grasp 8 common daily objects
including cup, fork, etc. The experimental results presented a similarity
coefficient $R^{2}$ of grasping process of 0.911, a Root Mean Squared Error
($RMSE$) of 2.47\degree, a success rate of grasping of 95.43$\%$, and an
average duration of grasping process of 3.07$\pm$0.41 s. Furthermore, grasping
experiments in a multi-object environment were conducted. The average accuracy
of intent estimation reached 94.35$\%$. Our methodologies offer a
groundbreaking approach to enhance the prosthetic hand's functionality and
provides valuable insights for future research.

while cHySST, an implementation of the asymptotically near-optimal HySST
algorithm, is capable of computing a trajectory to solve the optimal motion
planning problem for hybrid systems. cHyRRT is suitable for motion planning
problems where an optimal solution is not required, whereas cHySST is suitable
for such problems that prefer optimal solutions, within all feasible solutions.
The structure, components, and usage of the two tools are described. Examples

                                        <span>  For safe and effective operation of humanoid robots in human-populated
environments, the problem of commanding a large number of Degrees of Freedom
(DoF) while simultaneously considering dynamic obstacles and human proximity
has still not been solved. We present a new reactive motion controller that
commands two arms of a humanoid robot and three torso joints (17 DoF in total).
We formulate a quadratic program that seeks joint velocity commands respecting
multiple constraints while minimizing the magnitude of the velocities. We
introduce a new unified treatment of obstacles that dynamically maps visual and
proximity (pre-collision) and tactile (post-collision) obstacles as additional
constraints to the motion controller, in a distributed fashion over the surface
of the upper body of the iCub robot (with 2000 pressure-sensitive receptors).
This results in a bio-inspired controller that: (i) gives rise to a robot with
whole-body visuo-tactile awareness, resembling peripersonal space
representations, and (ii) produces human-like minimum jerk movement profiles.
The controller was extensively experimentally validated, including a physical
human-robot interaction scenario.

corrupted external sensors in the context of inertial navigation by leveraging
a switching Kalman Filter combined with parameter augmentation. Instead of
discarding the corrupted data, the proposed method retains and processes it,
running multiple observation models simultaneously and evaluating their
likelihoods to accurately identify the true state of the system. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach to both identify the moment that a sensor
becomes faulty and to correct for the resulting sensor behavior to maintain
accurate estimates. We demonstrate our approach on an application of balloon
navigation in the atmosphere and shuttle reentry. The results show that our
method can accurately recover the true system state even in the presence of
significant sensor bias, thereby improving the robustness and reliability of
state estimation systems under challenging conditions. We also provide a
statistical analysis of problem settings to determine when and where our method
is most accurate and where it fails.

                                        <span>  Autonomous vehicles require road information for their operation, usually in
form of HD maps. Since offline maps eventually become outdated or may only be
partially available, online HD map construction methods have been proposed to
infer map information from live sensor data. A key issue remains how to exploit
such partial or outdated map information as a prior. We introduce M3TR
(Multi-Masking Map Transformer), a generalist approach for HD map construction
both with and without map priors. We address shortcomings in ground truth
generation for Argoverse 2 and nuScenes and propose the first realistic
scenarios with semantically diverse map priors. Examining various query
designs, we use an improved method for integrating prior map elements into a HD
map construction model, increasing performance by +4.3 mAP. Finally, we show
that training across all prior scenarios yields a single Generalist model,
whose performance is on par with previous Expert models that can handle only
one specific type of map prior. M3TR thus is the first model capable of
leveraging variable map priors, making it suitable for real-world deployment.

                                        <span>  We demonstrate the effectiveness of simple observer-based linear feedback
policies for "pixels-to-torques" control of robotic systems using only a
robot-facing camera. Specifically, we show that the matrices of an image-based
Luenberger observer (linear state estimator) for a "student" output-feedback
policy can be learned from demonstration data provided by a "teacher"
state-feedback policy via simple linear-least-squares regression. The resulting
linear output-feedback controller maps directly from high-dimensional raw
images to torques while being amenable to the rich set of analytical tools from
linear systems theory, allowing us to enforce closed-loop stability constraints
in the learning problem. We also investigate a nonlinear extension of the
method via the Koopman embedding. Finally, we demonstrate the surprising
effectiveness of linear pixels-to-torques policies on a cartpole system, both
in simulation and on real hardware. The policy successfully executes both
stabilizing and swing-up trajectory-tracking tasks using only camera feedback
while subject to model mismatch, process and sensor noise, perturbations, and
occlusions. Open-source code for all experiments can be found here:

                                        <span>  Many problems in robotics involve creating or breaking multiple contacts
nearly simultaneously or in an indeterminate order. We present a novel general
purpose numerical integrator based on the theory of Event Selected Systems
(ESS). Many multicontact models are ESS, which has recently been shown to imply
that despite a discontinuous vector field, the flow of these systems is
continuous, piecewise smooth, and has a well defined orbital derivative for all
trajectories, which can be rapidly computed. We provide an elementary proof
that our integrator is first-order accurate and verify numerically that it is
in fact second-order accurate as its construction anticipated. We also compare
our integrator, implemented in NumPy, to a MuJoCo simulation on models with 2
to 100 contacts, and confirm that the increase in simulation time per contact
is nearly identical. The results suggest that this novel integrator can be
invaluable for modelling and control in many robotics applications.

of ground vehicles in Global Navigation Satellite System(GNSS)-denied off-road
scenarios. These environments are typically challenging for conventional
vision-based state estimation due to the lack of distinct visual landmarks and
the instability of vehicle poses. To address this, BEVRender generates
high-quality local bird's-eye-view(BEV) images of the local terrain.
Subsequently, these images are aligned with a geo referenced aerial map through
template matching to achieve accurate cross-view registration. Our approach
overcomes the inherent limitations of visual inertial odometry systems and the
substantial storage requirements of image-retrieval localization strategies,
which are susceptible to drift and scalability issues, respectively. Extensive
experimentation validates BEVRender's advancement over existing GNSS-denied
visual localization methods, demonstrating notable enhancements in both
localization accuracy and update frequency.

simplified scenarios, prohibiting the extraction of practical insights about
their relevance to real-world domains. Our key insight is that an understanding
of the inherent complexity of a social robot navigation scenario could help
characterize the limitations of existing navigation algorithms and provide
actionable directions for improvement. Through an exploration of recent
literature, we identify a series of factors contributing to the complexity of a
scenario, disambiguating between contextual and robot-related ones. We then
conduct a simulation study investigating how manipulations of contextual
factors impact the performance of a variety of navigation algorithms. We find
that dense and narrow environments correlate most strongly with performance
drops, while the heterogeneity of agent policies and directionality of
interactions have a less pronounced effect. Our findings motivate a shift
towards developing and testing algorithms under higher-complexity settings.

                                        <span>  Parameterizing finger rolling and finger-object contacts in a differentiable
manner is important for formulating dexterous manipulation as a trajectory
optimization problem. In contrast to previous methods which often assume
simplified geometries of the robot and object or do not explicitly model finger
rolling, we propose a method to further extend the capabilities of dexterous
manipulation by accounting for non-trivial geometries of both the robot and the
object. By integrating the object's Signed Distance Field (SDF) with a sampling
method, our method estimates contact and rolling-related variables in a
differentiable manner and includes those in a trajectory optimization
framework. This formulation naturally allows for the emergence of
finger-rolling behaviors, enabling the robot to locally adjust the contact
points. To evaluate our method, we introduce a benchmark featuring challenging
multi-finger dexterous manipulation tasks, such as screwdriver turning and
in-hand reorientation. Our method outperforms baselines in terms of achieving
desired object configurations and avoiding dropping the object. We also
successfully apply our method to a real-world screwdriver turning task and a
cuboid alignment task, demonstrating its robustness to the sim2real gap.

                                        <span>  LiDARs are widely used for mapping and localization in dynamic environments.
However, their high cost limits their widespread adoption. On the other hand,
monocular localization in LiDAR maps using inexpensive cameras is a
cost-effective alternative for large-scale deployment. Nevertheless, most
existing approaches struggle to generalize to new sensor setups and
environments, requiring retraining or fine-tuning. In this paper, we present
CMRNext, a novel approach for camera-LIDAR matching that is independent of
sensor-specific parameters, generalizable, and can be used in the wild for
monocular localization in LiDAR maps and camera-LiDAR extrinsic calibration.
CMRNext exploits recent advances in deep neural networks for matching
cross-modal data and standard geometric techniques for robust pose estimation.
We reformulate the point-pixel matching problem as an optical flow estimation
problem and solve the Perspective-n-Point problem based on the resulting
correspondences to find the relative pose between the camera and the LiDAR
point cloud. We extensively evaluate CMRNext on six different robotic
platforms, including three publicly available datasets and three in-house
robots. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that CMRNext outperforms
existing approaches on both tasks and effectively generalizes to previously
unseen environments and sensor setups in a zero-shot manner. We make the code
and pre-trained models publicly available at http://cmrnext.cs.uni-freiburg.de .

                                        <span>  We consider the problem of optimally composing a set of primitives to tackle
control tasks. To address this problem, we introduce Neo-FREE: a control
architecture inspired by the Thousand Brains Theory and Free Energy Principle
from cognitive sciences. In accordance with the neocortical (Neo) processes
postulated by the Thousand Brains Theory, Neo-FREE consists of functional units
returning control primitives. These are linearly combined by a gating mechanism
that minimizes the variational free energy (FREE). The problem of finding the
optimal primitives' weights is then recast as a finite-horizon optimal control
problem, which is convex even when the cost is not and the environment is
nonlinear, stochastic, non-stationary. The results yield an algorithm for
primitives composition and the effectiveness of Neo-FREE is illustrated via
in-silico and hardware experiments on an application involving robot navigation
in an environment with obstacles.

for effective embodied exploration and reasoning, especially in complex
environments over extended periods. Existing representations, such as
object-centric 3D scene graphs, oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling
scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships, making it
difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding. Moreover,
these representations lack natural mechanisms for active exploration and memory
management, hindering their application to lifelong autonomy. In this work, we
propose 3D-Mem, a novel 3D scene memory framework for embodied agents. 3D-Mem
employs informative multi-view images, termed Memory Snapshots, to represent
the scene and capture rich visual information of explored regions. It further
integrates frontier-based exploration by introducing Frontier
Snapshots-glimpses of unexplored areas-enabling agents to make informed
decisions by considering both known and potential new information. To support
lifelong memory in active exploration settings, we present an incremental
construction pipeline for 3D-Mem, as well as a memory retrieval technique for
memory management. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that
3D-Mem significantly enhances agents' exploration and reasoning capabilities in
3D environments, highlighting its potential for advancing applications in
embodied AI.

effectively used for motion planning for microrobot swarms in a global field.
We prove that Small-Time Local Controllability (STLC) in robot positions is
achievable through group-control, with the minimum number of groups required
for STLC being $\log_2(n + 2) + 1$ for $n$ robots. We then discuss the
trade-offs between control complexity, motion planning complexity, and motion
efficiency. We show how motion planning can be simplified if appropriate
primitives can be achieved through more complex control actions. We identify
motion planning problems that balance the number of motion primitives with
planning complexity. Various instantiations of these motion planning problems
are explored, with simulations used to demonstrate the effectiveness of
group-control.

in many industrial and commercial applications. However, before deploying UAVs
in the real world, it is essential to ensure they can operate safely in complex
environments, especially with limited communication capabilities. To address
this challenge, we propose a control-aware learning-based trajectory prediction
algorithm that can enable communication-efficient UAV swarm control in a
cluttered environment. Specifically, our proposed algorithm can enable each UAV
to predict the planned trajectories of its neighbors in scenarios with various
levels of communication capabilities. The predicted planned trajectories will
serve as input to a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) approach. The
proposed algorithm combines (1) a trajectory prediction model based on
EvolveGCN, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) that can handle dynamic graphs,
which is further enhanced by compressed messages from adjacent UAVs, and (2) a
KKT-informed training approach that applies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
conditions in the training process to encode DMPC information into the trained
neural network. We evaluate our proposed algorithm in a funnel-like
environment. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms
state-of-the-art benchmarks, providing close-to-optimal control performance and
robustness to limited communication capabilities and measurement noises.

paradigm, necessitating the collection of task data in an end-to-end manner.
Consequently, the learned policy tends to fail to tackle novel tasks. Moreover,
it is hard to localize the errors for a complex task with multiple stages due
to end-to-end learning. To address these challenges, we propose RoboMatrix, a
skill-centric and hierarchical framework for scalable task planning and
execution. We first introduce a novel skill-centric paradigm that extracts the
common meta-skills from different complex tasks. This allows for the capture of
embodied demonstrations through a skill-centric approach, enabling the
completion of open-world tasks by combining learned meta-skills. To fully
leverage meta-skills, we further develop a hierarchical framework that
decouples complex robot tasks into three interconnected layers: (1) a
high-level modular scheduling layer; (2) a middle-level skill layer; and (3) a
low-level hardware layer. Experimental results illustrate that our
skill-centric and hierarchical framework achieves remarkable generalization
performance across novel objects, scenes, tasks, and embodiments. This
framework offers a novel solution for robot task planning and execution in
open-world scenarios. Our software and hardware are available at

radar (e.g., marine radar) is widely employed for maritime vessel navigation,
providing effective long-range detection essential for situational awareness
and collision avoidance. Nevertheless, it exhibits limitations during berthing
operations where close-range object detection is critical. To address this
shortcoming, we incorporate W-band radar (e.g., Navtech imaging radar), which
excels in detecting nearby objects with a higher update rate. We present a
comprehensive maritime sensor dataset featuring multi-range detection
capabilities. This dataset integrates short-range LiDAR data, medium-range
W-band radar data, and long-range X-band radar data into a unified framework.
Additionally, it includes object labels for oceanic object detection usage,
derived from radar and stereo camera images. The dataset comprises seven
sequences collected from diverse regions with varying levels of estimation
difficulty, ranging from easy to challenging, and includes common locations
suitable for global localization tasks. This dataset serves as a valuable
resource for advancing research in place recognition, odometry estimation,
SLAM, object detection, and dynamic object elimination within maritime
environments. Dataset can be found in following link:

capturing microscale deformations using elastomer through densely arranged
optical imaging sensors to detect subtle data variations. To enable continuous
contact recognition, elastomers are crafted with curved surfaces to adjust to
changes in the contact area. However, this design leads to uneven deformations,
distorting tactile images and inaccurately reflecting the true elastomer
deformations. In this work, we propose a cyclic fusion strategy for
vision-based tactile sensing for precise contact data extraction and shape
feature integration at the pixel level. Utilizing frequency domain fusion, the
system merges topography as indicated by elastomer deformation, enhancing
information content by 8%, and regional information bias is reduced by 20% when
preserving structural consistency. Further, this system could effectively
extract and summarize micro-scale contact features, decreasing erroneous
predictions by 20% in defect detection via neural networks and reducing surface
projection bias by 50% in surface depth reconstruction. Using this strategy,
the measurement minimizes data interference, accurately depicting object
morphology on tactile images and enhancing tactile sensation restoration.

                                        <span>  This paper investigates performance guarantees on coverage-based ergodic
exploration methods in environments containing disturbances. Ergodic
exploration methods generate trajectories for autonomous robots such that time
spent in each area of the exploration space is proportional to the utility of
exploring in the area. We find that it is possible to use techniques from
reachability analysis to solve for optimal controllers that guarantee ergodic
coverage and are robust against disturbances. We formulate ergodic search as a
differential game between the controller optimizing for ergodicity and an
external disturbance, and we derive the reachability equations for ergodic
search using an extended-state Bolza-form transform of the ergodic problem.
Contributions include the computation of a continuous value function for the
ergodic exploration problem and the derivation of a controller that provides
guarantees for coverage under disturbances. Our approach leverages
neural-network-based methods to solve the reachability equations; we also
construct a robust model-predictive controller for comparison. Simulated and
experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for generating
robust ergodic trajectories for search and exploration on a 1D system with an
external disturbance force.

corrupted with bounded non-stochastic noise, i.e., noise that is unknown a
priori and that is not necessarily governed by a stochastic model. We focus on
safety constraints that take the form of time-varying convex constraints such
as collision-avoidance and control-effort constraints. We provide an algorithm
with bounded dynamic regret, i.e., bounded suboptimality against an optimal
clairvoyant controller that knows the realization of the noise a prior. We are
motivated by the future of autonomy where robots will autonomously perform
complex tasks despite real-world unpredictable disturbances such as wind gusts.
To develop the algorithm, we capture our problem as a sequential game between a
controller and an adversary, where the controller plays first, choosing the
control input, whereas the adversary plays second, choosing the noise's
realization. The controller aims to minimize its cumulative tracking error
despite being unable to know the noise's realization a prior. We validate our
algorithm in simulated scenarios of (i) an inverted pendulum aiming to stay
upright, and (ii) a quadrotor aiming to fly to a goal location through an
unknown cluttered environment.

                                        <span>  Photorealistic simulators are essential for the training and evaluation of
vision-centric autonomous vehicles (AVs). At their core is Novel View Synthesis
(NVS), a crucial capability that generates diverse unseen viewpoints to
accommodate the broad and continuous pose distribution of AVs. Recent advances
in radiance fields, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting, achieve photorealistic
rendering at real-time speeds and have been widely used in modeling large-scale
driving scenes. However, their performance is commonly evaluated using an
interpolated setup with highly correlated training and test views. In contrast,
extrapolation, where test views largely deviate from training views, remains
underexplored, limiting progress in generalizable simulation technology. To
address this gap, we leverage publicly available AV datasets with multiple
traversals, multiple vehicles, and multiple cameras to build the first
Extrapolated Urban View Synthesis (EUVS) benchmark. Meanwhile, we conduct
quantitative and qualitative evaluations of state-of-the-art Gaussian Splatting
methods across different difficulty levels. Our results show that Gaussian
Splatting is prone to overfitting to training views. Besides, incorporating
diffusion priors and improving geometry cannot fundamentally improve NVS under
large view changes, highlighting the need for more robust approaches and
large-scale training. We have released our data to help advance self-driving
and urban robotics simulation technology.

diffusion model is trained to denoise a set of tokens with independent
per-token noise levels. We apply Diffusion Forcing to sequence generative
modeling by training a causal next-token prediction model to generate one or
several future tokens without fully diffusing past ones. Our approach is shown
to combine the strengths of next-token prediction models, such as
variable-length generation, with the strengths of full-sequence diffusion
models, such as the ability to guide sampling to desirable trajectories. Our
method offers a range of additional capabilities, such as (1) rolling-out
sequences of continuous tokens, such as video, with lengths past the training
horizon, where baselines diverge and (2) new sampling and guiding schemes that
uniquely profit from Diffusion Forcing's variable-horizon and causal
architecture, and which lead to marked performance gains in decision-making and
planning tasks. In addition to its empirical success, our method is proven to
optimize a variational lower bound on the likelihoods of all subsequences of
tokens drawn from the true joint distribution. Project website:

                                        <span>  In this article we address the multi-robot task allocation problem, where
robots must cooperatively assign themselves to accomplish a set of tasks in
their environment. We consider the colony maintenance problem as an example,
where a team of robots are tasked with continuously maintaining the energy
supply of a central colony. We model this as a global game, where each robot
measures the energy level of the colony, and the current number of assigned
robots, to determine whether or not to forage for energy sources. The key to
our approach is introducing a negative feedback term into the robots' utility,
which also eliminates the trivial solution where foraging or not foraging are
strictly dominant strategies. We compare our approach qualitatively to existing
global games, where a positive positive feedback term admits threshold-based
decision making, and encourages many robots to forage simultaneously. We show
how positive feedback can lead to a cascading failure in the presence of a
human who recruits robots, and we demonstrate the resilience of our approach in
simulation.

controlled settings to dynamic, real-world public environments calls for
enhanced adaptability in robotic systems. This can go beyond algorithmic
navigation or traditional HRI strategies in structured settings, requiring the
ability to navigate complex public urban systems containing multifaceted
dynamics and various socio-technical needs. Therefore, our proposed workshop
seeks to extend the boundaries of adaptive HRI research beyond predictable,
semi-structured contexts and highlight opportunities for adaptable robot
interactions in urban public environments. This half-day workshop aims to
explore design opportunities and challenges in creating contextually-adaptive
HRI within these spaces and establish a network of interested parties within
the OzCHI research community. By fostering ongoing discussions, sharing of
insights, and collaborations, we aim to catalyse future research that empowers
robots to navigate the inherent uncertainties and complexities of real-world
public interactions.

                                        <span>  As extreme weather events become more common and threaten power grids, the
continuing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces a growing opportunity
for their use as a distributed energy storage resource. This energy storage can
be used as backup generation through the use of vehicle-to-grid (V2G)
technology, where electricity is sent back from EV batteries to the grid. With
enough participation from EV owners, V2G can mitigate outages during grid
emergencies. In order to investigate a practical application of V2G, this study
leverages a vast array of real-world data, such as survey results on V2G
participation willingness, historical outage data within ERCOT, current EV
registrations, and demographic data. This data informs realistic emergency grid
scenarios with V2G support using a synthetic transmission grid for Travis
County. The results find that as EV ownership rises in the coming years, the
simultaneous facilitation of bidirectional charging availability would allow
for V2G to play a substantial role in preventing involuntary load shed as a
result of emergencies like winter storms.

communication for the SCADA and wide-area measurement system data. Power
utilities world-wide use various SCADA protocols, namely DNP3, Modbus, and IEC
61850, for the data exchanges across substation field devices, remote terminal
units (RTUs), and control center applications. Adversaries may exploit
compromised SCADA protocols for the reconnaissance, data exfiltration,
vulnerability assessment, and injection of stealthy cyberattacks to affect
power system operation. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to
generate robust rule sets. We integrate the rule sets into an intrusion
detection system (IDS), which continuously monitors the DNP3 data traffic at a
substation network and detects intrusions and anomalies in real-time. To enable
CPS-aware wide-area situational awareness, we integrated the methodology into
an open-source distributed-IDS (D-IDS) framework. The D-IDS facilitates central
monitoring of the detected anomalies from the geographically distributed
substations and to the control center. The proposed algorithm provides an
optimal solution to detect network intrusions and abnormal behavior. Different
types of IDS rules based on packet payload, packet flow, and time threshold are
generated. Further, IDS testing and evaluation is performed with a set of rules
in different sequences. The detection time is measured for different IDS rules,
and the results are plotted. All the experiments are conducted at Power Cyber
Lab, Iowa State University, for multiple power grid models. After successful
testing and evaluation, knowledge and implementation are transferred to field
deployment.

are widely reported in the literature because they have a lower initial cost
compared with bifacial systems. However, limited investigation of both systems
has been done on a utility scale with different performance indicators. This
paper introduces a multifaceted comparative analysis including various aspects
like energy generation, reliability, environmental effect, economic viability,
and footprint area. Real measured data, including ambient temperature, solar
irradiance, and a utility-scale load, were used for studying both systems in
the City of Detroit. The optimal system sizing and energy management strategy
are attained using the Whale optimization algorithm. Minimizing the loss of
power supply probability and sizing the number of photovoltaic panels (NPV) are
carried out for both cases. Results revealed that the bifacial solar system
generates more power with a lower NPV, a smaller installation area, and hence a
lower levelized cost of energy for the entire project lifetime compared to the
monofacial system. Accordingly, the bifacial system outlined in this paper is
recommended and can be implemented in various locations to establish a
sustainable solar energy system that is economically feasible with clean energy
production for the entire project's lifespan.

in energy markets, data markets have been proposed as a means to enable
increased data access. However, most extant literature considers energy markets
and data markets separately, which ignores the interdependence between them. In
addition, existing data market frameworks rely on a trusted entity to clear the
market. This paper proposes a joint energy and data market focusing on the
day-ahead retailer energy procurement problem with uncertain demand. The
retailer can purchase differentially-private smart meter data from consumers to
reduce uncertainty. The problem is modelled as an integrated forecasting and
optimisation problem providing a means of valuing data directly rather than
valuing forecasts or forecast accuracy. Value is determined by the Wasserstein
distance, enabling privacy to be preserved during the valuation and procurement
process. The value of joint energy and data clearing is highlighted through
numerical case studies using both synthetic and real smart meter data.

                                        <span>  This paper presents a mathematical framework for modeling the dynamic effects
of three fault categories and six fault variants in the ink channels of
high-end industrial printers. It also introduces a hybrid approach that
combines model-based and data-based methods to detect and isolate these faults
effectively. A key challenge in these systems is that the same piezo device is
used for actuation (generating ink droplets) and for sensing and, as a
consequence, sensing is only available when there is no actuation. The proposed
Fault Detection (FD) filter, based on the healthy model, uses the piezo
self-sensing signal to generate a residual, while taking the above challenge
into account. The system is flagged as faulty if the residual energy exceeds a
threshold. Fault Isolation (FI) is achieved through linear regression or a
k-nearest neighbors approach to identify the most likely fault category and
variant. The resulting hybrid Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) method
overcomes traditional limitations of model-based methods by isolating different
types of faults affecting the same entries (i.e., equations) in the ink channel
dynamics. Moreover, it is shown to outperform purely data-driven methods in
fault isolation, especially when data is scarce. Experimental validation
demonstrates superior FDI performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

                                        <span>  This study explores the design of a memory-based dynamic event-triggered
mechanisms (DETM) scheme for heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs)
characterized by interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno (IT2 T-S) fuzzy models. To
address the complex nonlinear uncertainties inherent in such systems, discrete
IT2 T-S fuzzy models are employed to accurately capture system dynamics. In
response to the limitations on communication resources and computational
capabilities within MASs, this research introduces a distributed DETM approach
based on a dynamic threshold method. This mechanism effectively minimizes
unnecessary communication while maintaining robust performance. The proposed
memory-based control strategy not only reduces the conservatism associated with
controller design conditions but also enhances overall controller performance.
Furthermore, leveraging a non-parallel distributed compensation (non-PDC)
strategy, a novel derivation method is developed for controller design
conditions that significantly decreases conservatism. This leads to sufficient
conditions for the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. The designed
distributed event-triggered controllers improve the overall performance of
MASs, as evidenced by numerical simulations that validate the effectiveness of
the proposed approach. Overall, these findings advance the state-of-the-art in
control strategies for heterogeneous MASs, offering practical solutions for
real-world applications where resource constraints are critical.

                                        <span>  The EU targets 10 Mt of green hydrogen production by 2030, but has not
committed to targets for 2040. Green hydrogen competes with carbon capture and
storage, biomass and imports in reaching emissions reductions; earlier studies
have demonstrated the great uncertainty in future cost-optimal development of
green hydrogen. In spite of this, we show that Europe risks little by setting
green hydrogen production targets at around 25 Mt by 2040. Employing an
extensive scenario analysis combined with novel near-optimal techniques, we
find that this target results in systems that are within 10% of cost-optimal in
most considered scenarios. Setting concrete targets is important in order to
resolve significant uncertainty which hampers investments. Targeting green
hydrogen reduces the dependence on carbon capture and storage and green fuel
imports, making for a more robust European climate strategy.

identify open challenges in this field. We start by explaining the fundamentals
of software architecture in distributed systems and the distinguishing
requirements of Automated Vehicles. We then distinguish between communication
middlewares and architecture platforms and highlight their key principles and
differences. Next, we present five state-of-the-art middlewares as well as
their capabilities and functions. We explore how these middlewares could be
applied in the design of future vehicle software and their role in the
automotive domain. Finally, we compare the five middlewares presented and
discuss open research challenges.

barrier function (DOp-CBF) designed for a robust safety control system under
external disturbances. This framework emphasizes that the safety bounds are
relevant to the disturbances, acknowledging the critical impact of disturbances
on system safety. This work incorporates a disturbance observer (DO) as an
adaptive mechanism of the safety bounds design. Instead of considering the
worst-case scenario, the safety bounds are dynamically adjusted using DO. The
forward invariance of the proposed method regardless of the observer error is
ensured, and the corresponding optimal control formulation is presented. The
performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulations of a
cruise control problem under varying road grades. The influence of road grade
on the safe distance between vehicles is analyzed and managed using a DO. The
results demonstrate the advantages of this approach in maintaining safety and
improving system performance under disturbances.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes a novel trajectory generation method based on Model
Predictive Control (MPC) for agile landing of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
onto an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV)'s deck in harsh conditions. The
trajectory generation exploits the state predictions of the USV to create
periodically updated trajectories for a multirotor UAV to precisely land on the
deck of a moving USV even in cases where the deck's inclination is continuously
changing. We use an MPC-based scheme to create trajectories that consider both
the UAV dynamics and the predicted states of the USV up to the first derivative
of position and orientation. Compared to existing approaches, our method
dynamically modifies the penalization matrices to precisely follow the
corresponding states with respect to the flight phase. Especially during the
landing maneuver, the UAV synchronizes attitude with the USV's, allowing for
fast landing on a tilted deck. Simulations show the method's reliability in
various sea conditions up to Rough sea (wave height 4 m), outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in landing speed and accuracy, with twice the
precision on average. Finally, real-world experiments validate the simulation
results, demonstrating robust landings on a moving USV, while all computations
are performed in real-time onboard the UAV.

domain has rapidly increased. As a major part of this energy consumption is due
to users' workloads, it is evident that users need to be aware of the energy
footprint of their applications. Compute Energy and Emissions Monitoring Stack
(CEEMS) has been designed to address this issue. CEEMS can report energy
consumption and equivalent emissions of user workloads in real time for HPC and
cloud platforms alike. Besides CPU energy usage, it supports reporting energy
usage of workloads on NVIDIA and AMD GPU accelerators. CEEMS has been built
around the prominent open-source tools in the observability eco-system like
Prometheus and Grafana. CEEMS has been designed to be extensible and it allows
the Data Center (DC) operators to easily define the energy estimation rules of
user workloads based on the underlying hardware. This paper explains the
architectural overview of CEEMS, data sources that are used to measure energy
usage and estimate equivalent emissions and potential use cases of CEEMS from
operator and user perspectives. Finally, the paper will conclude by describing
how CEEMS deployment on the Jean-Zay supercomputing platform is capable of
monitoring more than 1400 nodes that have a daily job churn rate of around 20k
jobs.

                                        <span>  This work is concerned with synthesizing safety controllers for discrete-time
nonlinear systems beyond polynomials with unknown mathematical models using the
notion of k-inductive control barrier certificates (k-CBCs). Conventional CBC
conditions (with k=1) for ensuring safety over dynamical systems are often
restrictive, as they require the CBCs to be non-increasing at every time step.
Inspired by the success of k-induction in software verification, k-CBCs relax
this requirement by allowing the barrier function to be non-increasing over k
steps, while permitting k-1 (one-step) increases, each up to a threshold
epsilon. This relaxation enhances the likelihood of finding feasible k-CBCs
while providing safety guarantees across the dynamical systems. Despite showing
promise, existing approaches for constructing k-CBCs often rely on precise
mathematical knowledge of system dynamics, which is frequently unavailable in
practical scenarios. In this work, we address the case where the underlying
dynamics are unknown, a common occurrence in real-world applications, and
employ the concept of persistency of excitation, grounded in Willems et al.'s
fundamental lemma. This result implies that input-output data from a single
trajectory can capture the behavior of an unknown system, provided the
collected data fulfills a specific rank condition. We employ sum-of-squares
(SOS) programming to synthesize the k-CBC as well as the safety controller
directly from data while ensuring the safe behavior of the unknown system. The
efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through a set of physical benchmarks
with unknown dynamics, including a DC motor, an RLC circuit, a nonlinear
nonpolynomial car, and a nonlinear polynomial Lorenz attractor.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes a distributed data-driven framework to address the
challenge of dynamics learning from a large amount of training data for optimal
control purposes, named distributed deep Koopman learning for control (DDKC).
Suppose a system states-inputs trajectory and a multi-agent system (MAS), the
key idea of DDKC is to assign each agent in MAS an offline partial trajectory,
and each agent approximates the unknown dynamics linearly relying on the deep
neural network (DNN) and Koopman operator theory by communicating information
with other agents to reach a consensus of the approximated dynamics for all
agents in MAS. Simulations on a surface vehicle first show that the proposed
method achieves the consensus in terms of the learned dynamics and the learned
dynamics from each agent can achieve reasonably small estimation errors over
the testing data. Furthermore, simulations in combination with model predictive
control (MPC) to drive the surface vehicle for goal-tracking and
station-keeping tasks demonstrate the learned dynamics from DDKC are precise
enough to be used for the optimal control design.

                                        <span>  The anthropomorphism of grasping process significantly benefits the
experience and grasping efficiency of prosthetic hand wearers. Currently,
prosthetic hands controlled by signals such as brain-computer interfaces (BCI)
and electromyography (EMG) face difficulties in precisely recognizing the
amputees' grasping gestures and executing anthropomorphic grasp processes.
Although prosthetic hands equipped with vision systems enables the objects'
feature recognition, they lack perception of human grasping intention.
Therefore, this paper explores the estimation of grasping gestures solely
through visual data to accomplish anthropopathic grasping control and the
determination of grasping intention within a multi-object environment. To
address this, we propose the Spatial Geometry-based Gesture Mapping (SG-GM)
method, which constructs gesture functions based on the geometric features of
the human hand grasping processes. It's subsequently implemented on the
prosthetic hand. Furthermore, we propose the Motion Trajectory Regression-based
Grasping Intent Estimation (MTR-GIE) algorithm. This algorithm predicts
pre-grasping object utilizing regression prediction and prior spatial
segmentation estimation derived from the prosthetic hand's position and
trajectory. The experiments were conducted to grasp 8 common daily objects
including cup, fork, etc. The experimental results presented a similarity
coefficient $R^{2}$ of grasping process of 0.911, a Root Mean Squared Error
($RMSE$) of 2.47\degree, a success rate of grasping of 95.43$\%$, and an
average duration of grasping process of 3.07$\pm$0.41 s. Furthermore, grasping
experiments in a multi-object environment were conducted. The average accuracy
of intent estimation reached 94.35$\%$. Our methodologies offer a
groundbreaking approach to enhance the prosthetic hand's functionality and
provides valuable insights for future research.

under uncertainties that are linearly parameterized with known nonlinear
features. Nonetheless, it is often difficult to obtain such nonlinear features.
To address this difficulty, recent progress has been made in integrating
meta-learning with adaptive control to learn such nonlinear features from data.
However, these meta-learning-based control methods rely on classical adaptation
laws using gradient descent, which is confined to the Euclidean geometry. In
this paper, we propose a novel method that combines meta-learning and
adaptation laws based on mirror descent, a popular generalization of gradient
descent, which takes advantage of the potentially non-Euclidean geometry of the
parameter space. In our approach, meta-learning not only learns the nonlinear
features but also searches for a suitable mirror-descent potential function
that optimizes control performance. Through numerical simulations, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning efficient
representations and real-time tracking control performance under uncertain
dynamics.

a switching Kalman Filter combined with parameter augmentation. Instead of
discarding the corrupted data, the proposed method retains and processes it,
running multiple observation models simultaneously and evaluating their
likelihoods to accurately identify the true state of the system. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach to both identify the moment that a sensor
becomes faulty and to correct for the resulting sensor behavior to maintain
accurate estimates. We demonstrate our approach on an application of balloon
navigation in the atmosphere and shuttle reentry. The results show that our
method can accurately recover the true system state even in the presence of
significant sensor bias, thereby improving the robustness and reliability of
state estimation systems under challenging conditions. We also provide a
statistical analysis of problem settings to determine when and where our method
is most accurate and where it fails.

limiting or eliminating human involvement in the driving tasks. The theoretical
validity of the AV platooning strategies has been established and practical
applications are being tested under real-world conditions. The emergence of
sensors, communication, and control strategies has resulted in rapid and
constant evolution of AV platooning strategies. In this paper, we review the
state-of-the-art knowledge in AV longitudinal platoon formation using a
five-component platooning framework, which includes vehicle model,
information-receiving process, information flow topology, spacing policy, and
controller and discuss the advantages and limitations of the components. Based

potential future research directions are presented.

                                        <span>  For many recommender systems, the primary data source is a historical record
of user clicks. The associated click matrix is often very sparse, as the number
of users x products can be far larger than the number of clicks. Such sparsity
is accentuated in cold-start settings, which makes the efficient use of
metadata information of paramount importance. In this work, we propose a simple
approach to address cold-start recommendations by leveraging content metadata,
Metadata Alignment for cold-start Recommendation. We show that this approach
can readily augment existing matrix factorization and autoencoder approaches,
enabling a smooth transition to top performing algorithms in warmer set-ups.
Our experimental results indicate three separate contributions: first, we show
that our proposed framework largely beats SOTA results on 4 cold-start datasets
with different sparsity and scale characteristics, with gains ranging from
+8.4% to +53.8% on reported ranking metrics; second, we provide an ablation
study on the utility of semantic features, and proves the additional gain
obtained by leveraging such features ranges between +46.8% and +105.5%; and
third, our approach is by construction highly competitive in warm set-ups, and
we propose a closed-form solution outperformed by SOTA results by only 0.8% on
average.

                                        <span>  We consider the problem of optimally composing a set of primitives to tackle
control tasks. To address this problem, we introduce Neo-FREE: a control
architecture inspired by the Thousand Brains Theory and Free Energy Principle
from cognitive sciences. In accordance with the neocortical (Neo) processes
postulated by the Thousand Brains Theory, Neo-FREE consists of functional units
returning control primitives. These are linearly combined by a gating mechanism
that minimizes the variational free energy (FREE). The problem of finding the
optimal primitives' weights is then recast as a finite-horizon optimal control
problem, which is convex even when the cost is not and the environment is
nonlinear, stochastic, non-stationary. The results yield an algorithm for
primitives composition and the effectiveness of Neo-FREE is illustrated via
in-silico and hardware experiments on an application involving robot navigation
in an environment with obstacles.

drift and diffusion coefficients of multi-dimensional non-linear stochastic
differential equations, which relies upon discrete-time observations of the
state. The key idea essentially consists of fitting a RKHS-based approximation
of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation to such observations, yielding
theoretical estimates of non-asymptotic learning rates which, unlike previous
works, become increasingly tighter when the regularity of the unknown drift and
diffusion coefficients becomes higher. Our method being kernel-based, offline
pre-processing may be profitably leveraged to enable efficient numerical
implementation, offering excellent balance between precision and computational

                                        <span>  Hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks (HLWNets)
are an emerging indoor wireless communication paradigm, which combines the
advantages of the capacious optical spectra of LiFi and ubiquitous coverage of
WiFi. Meanwhile, load balancing (LB) becomes a key challenge in resource
management for such hybrid networks. The existing LB methods are mostly
network-centric, relying on a central unit to make a solution for the users all
at once. Consequently, the solution needs to be updated for all users at the
same pace, regardless of their moving status. This would affect the network
performance in two aspects: i) when the update frequency is low, it would
compromise the connectivity of fast-moving users; ii) when the update frequency
is high, it would cause unnecessary handovers as well as hefty feedback costs
for slow-moving users. Motivated by this, we investigate user-centric LB which
allows users to update their solutions at different paces. The research is
developed upon our previous work on adaptive target-condition neural network
(ATCNN), which can conduct LB for individual users in quasi-static channels. In
this paper, a deep neural network (DNN) model is designed to enable an adaptive
update interval for each individual user. This new model is termed as
mobility-supporting neural network (MSNN). Associating MSNN with ATCNN, a
user-centric LB framework named mobility-supporting ATCNN (MS-ATCNN) is
proposed to handle resource management and mobility management simultaneously.
Results show that at the same level of average update interval, MS-ATCNN can
achieve a network throughput up to 215\% higher than conventional LB methods
such as game theory, especially for a larger number of users. In addition,
MS-ATCNN costs an ultra low runtime at the level of 100s $\mu$s, which is two
to three orders of magnitude lower than game theory.

pursuer's safety regarding collision avoidance, sensing range, and input
saturation. An input-constrained CBF is proposed to dynamically regulate the
pursuer's control, ensuring effective target pursuit even when the target
performs evasive maneuvers. To further ensure safety, two sets of CBF
constraints are designed to regulate the pursuer's position, enabling it to
keep the target within the sensing range while avoiding collision in complex
environments with external disturbances. These three CBFs collectively form our
safety filter, which filters unsafe outputs from RL by solving a Quadratic
Program (QP). Finally, the safety filter, combined with a switch strategy that
enhances the feasibility of solving its QP, constitutes the Control Barrier
Function (CBF)-Safe Reinforcement Learning (CSRL) algorithm, whose solutions
are proven to satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for all safety
constraints. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the CSRL
algorithm, demonstrating its ability to handle complex pursuit scenarios while
maintaining safety and improving control performance.

on past interactions, can exhibit a variety of undesirable behaviours including
convergence to suboptimal equilibria, cycling, and chaos. While central
planners can employ incentives to mitigate such behaviors and steer game
dynamics towards desirable outcomes, the effectiveness of such interventions
critically relies on accurately predicting agents' responses to these
incentives -- a task made particularly challenging when the underlying dynamics
are unknown and observations are limited. To address this challenge, this work
introduces the Side Information Assisted Regression with Model Predictive
Control (SIAR-MPC) framework. We extend the recently introduced SIAR method to
incorporate the effect of control, enabling it to utilize side-information
constraints inherent to game-theoretic applications to model agents' responses
to incentives from scarce data. MPC then leverages this model to implement
dynamic incentive adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
SIAR-MPC in guiding systems towards socially optimal equilibria, stabilizing
chaotic and cycling behaviors. Notably, it achieves these results in
data-scarce settings of few learning samples, where well-known system
identification methods paired with MPC show less effective results.

                                        <span>  We study how to safely control nonlinear control-affine systems that are
corrupted with bounded non-stochastic noise, i.e., noise that is unknown a
priori and that is not necessarily governed by a stochastic model. We focus on
safety constraints that take the form of time-varying convex constraints such
as collision-avoidance and control-effort constraints. We provide an algorithm
with bounded dynamic regret, i.e., bounded suboptimality against an optimal
clairvoyant controller that knows the realization of the noise a prior. We are
motivated by the future of autonomy where robots will autonomously perform
complex tasks despite real-world unpredictable disturbances such as wind gusts.
To develop the algorithm, we capture our problem as a sequential game between a
controller and an adversary, where the controller plays first, choosing the
control input, whereas the adversary plays second, choosing the noise's
realization. The controller aims to minimize its cumulative tracking error
despite being unable to know the noise's realization a prior. We validate our
algorithm in simulated scenarios of (i) an inverted pendulum aiming to stay
upright, and (ii) a quadrotor aiming to fly to a goal location through an
unknown cluttered environment.

                                        <span>  This paper presents the concept of an equivalence relation between the set of
optimal control problems. By leveraging this concept, we show that the boundary
of the reachability set can be constructed by the solutions of time optimal
problems. Alongside, a more generalized equivalence theorem is presented
together. The findings facilitate the use of solution structures from a certain
class of optimal control problems to address problems in corresponding
equivalent classes. As a byproduct, we state and prove the construction methods
of the reachability sets of three-dimensional curves with prescribed curvature
bound. The findings are twofold: Firstly, we prove that any boundary point of
the reachability set, with the terminal direction taken into account, can be
accessed via curves of H, CSC, CCC, or their respective subsegments, where H
denotes a helicoidal arc, C a circular arc with maximum curvature, and S a
straight segment. Secondly, we show that any boundary point of the reachability
set, without considering the terminal direction, can be accessed by curves of
CC, CS, or their respective subsegments. These findings extend the developments
presented in literature regarding planar curves, or Dubins car dynamics, into
spatial curves in $\mathbb{R}^3$. For higher dimensions, we confirm that the
problem of identifying the reachability set of curvature bounded paths subsumes
the well-known Markov-Dubins problem. These advancements in understanding the
reachability of curvature bounded paths in $\mathbb{R}^3$ hold significant
practical implications, particularly in the contexts of mission planning
problems and time optimal guidance.

                                        <span>  Multi-phase trajectories of aerospace vehicle systems involve multiple flight
segments whose transitions may be triggered by boolean logic in continuous
state variables, control and time. When the boolean logic is represented using
only states and/or time, such systems are termed autonomously switched hybrid
systems. The relaxed autonomously switched hybrid system approach (RASHS) was
previously introduced to simplify the trajectory optimization process of such
systems in the indirect framework when the boolean logic is solely represented
using AND operations. This investigation enables cases involving arbitrary
discrete logic. The new approach is termed the Generalized Relaxed Autonomously
Switched Hybrid System (GRASHS) approach. Similar to the RASHS approach, the
outcome of the GRASHS approach is the transformation of the necessary
conditions of optimality from a multi-point boundary value problem to a
two-point boundary value problem, which is simpler to handle. This is
accomplished by converting the arbitrary boolean logic to the disjunctive
normal form and applying smoothing using sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent
functions. The GRASHS approach is demonstrated by optimizing a Mars entry,
descent, and landing trajectory, where the parachute descent segment is active
when the velocity is below the parachute deployment velocity or the altitude is
below the parachute deployment altitude, and the altitude is above the powered
descent initiation altitude. This set of conditions represents a combination of
AND and OR logic. The previously introduced RASHS approach is not designed to
handle such problems. The proposed GRASHS approach aims to fill this gap.

end-effector of a redundant robot manipulator to traverse a Cartesian path by
optimizing the trajectory of its joints. Each joint has limits in the ranges of
position, velocity and acceleration, the latter making jerks in joint space
undesirable. The proposed approach takes this nonlinear optimization problem
whose variables are path speed and joint trajectory and reformulates it into a
bi-level problem. The lower-level formulation is a convex subproblem that
considers a fixed joint trajectory and maximizes path speed while considering
all joint velocity and acceleration constraints. Under particular conditions,
this subproblem has a closed-form solution. Then, we solve a higher-level
subproblem by leveraging the directional derivative of the lower-level value
with respect to the joint trajectory parameters. In particular, we use this
direction to implement a Primal-Dual method that considers the path accuracy
and joint position constraints. We show the efficacy of our proposed approach
with simulations and experimental results.

the massively parallel compute resources offered by modern many- and multi-core
compute platforms. However, efficient distributed solution techniques are
required, especially for large-scale linear programs. This article describes a
new decomposition technique for systems of linear equations implemented in the
parallel interior-point solver PIPS-IPM++. The algorithm exploits a matrix
structure commonly found in optimization problems: a doubly-bordered
block-diagonal or arrowhead structure. This structure is preserved in the
linear KKT systems solved during each iteration of the interior-point method.
We present a hierarchical Schur complement decomposition that distributes and
solves the linear optimization problem; it is designed for high-performance
architectures and scales well with the availability of additional computing
resources. The decomposition approach uses the border constraints' locality to
decouple the factorization process. Our approach is motivated by large-scale
unit commitment problems. We demonstrate the performance of our method on a set
of mid-to large-scale instances, some of which have more than 10^9 nonzeros in
their constraint matrix.

                                        <span>  The branching algorithm is a fundamental technique for designing fast
exponential-time algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems
exactly. It divides the entire solution space into independent search branches
using predetermined branching rules, and ignores the search on suboptimal
branches to reduce the time complexity. The complexity of a branching algorithm
is primarily determined by the branching rules it employs, which are often
designed by human experts. In this paper, we show how to automate this process
with a focus on the maximum independent set problem. The main contribution is
an algorithm that efficiently generate optimal branching rules for a given
sub-graph with tens of vertices. Its efficiency enables us to generate the
branching rules on-the-fly, which is provably optimal and significantly reduces
the number of branches compared to existing methods that rely on
expert-designed branching rules. Numerical experiment on 3-regular graphs shows
an average complexity of O(1.0441^n) can be achieved, better than any previous
methods.

Boltzmann density by solving the underlying continuity equation in the low-rank
tensor train (TT) format. It is based on the annealing path commonly used in
MCMC literature, which is given by the linear interpolation in the space of
energies. Inspired by Sequential Monte Carlo, we alternate between
deterministic time steps from the TT representation of the flow field and
stochastic steps, which include Langevin and resampling steps. These adjust the
relative weights of the different modes of the target distribution and anneal
to the correct path distribution. We showcase the efficiency of our method on
multiple numerical examples.

                                        <span>  The Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm is a widely used and efficient
first-order method for solving constrained optimization problems due to its
simplicity and scalability in large design spaces. Building on recent
advancements in the PGD algorithm where an inertial step component has been
introduced to improve efficiency in solving constrained optimization problems
this study introduces two key enhancements to further improve the algorithm's
performance and adaptability in large-scale design spaces. First, univariate
constraints (such as design variable bounds constraints) are directly
incorporated into the projection step via the Schur complement and an improved
active set algorithm with bulk constraints manipulation, avoiding issues with
min-max clipping. Second, the update step is decomposed relative to the
constraint vector space, enabling a post-projection adjustment based on the
state of the constraints and an approximation of the Lagrangian, significantly
improving the algorithm's robustness for problems with nonlinear constraints.
Applied to a topology optimization problem for heat sink design, the proposed
PGD algorithm demonstrates performance comparable to or exceeding that of the
Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA), with minimal parameter tuning. These results
position the enhanced PGD as a robust tool for complex optimization problems
with large variable space, such as topology optimization problems.

solvers on the NP-hard Max-Cut and QUBO problems, examining their solution
quality relative to the global optima and their computational efficiency. We
benchmark the new fast annealing D-Wave quantum processing unit (QPU) and
D-Wave Hybrid solver against the state-of-the-art classical simulated annealing
algorithm (SA) and Toshiba's simulated bifurcation machine (SBM). Our study
leverages three datasets encompassing 139 instances of the Max-Cut problem with
sizes ranging from 100 to 10,000 nodes. For instances below 251 nodes, global
optima are known and reported, while for larger instances, we utilize the
best-known solutions from the literature. Our findings reveal that for the
smaller instances where the global optimum is known, the Hybrid solver and SA
algorithm consistently achieve the global optimum, outperforming the QPU. For
larger instances where global optima are unknown, we observe that the SBM and
the slower variant of SA deliver competitive solution quality, while the Hybrid
solver and the faster variant of SA performed noticeably worse. Although
computing time varies due to differing underlying hardware, the Hybrid solver
and the SBM demonstrate both efficient computation times, while for SA
reduction in computation time can be achieved at the expense of solution
quality.

                                        <span>  This paper aims to address the phase retrieval problem from subgaussian
measurements with arbitrary noise, with a focus on devising robust and
efficient algorithms for solving non-convex problems. To ensure uniqueness of
solutions in the subgaussian setting, we explore two commonly used assumptions:
either the subgaussian measurements satisfy a fourth-moment condition or the
target signals exhibit non-peakiness. For each scenario, we introduce a novel
spectral initialization method that yields robust initial estimates. Building
on this, we employ leave-one-out arguments to show that the classical Wirtinger
flow algorithm achieves a linear rate of convergence for both real-valued and
complex-valued cases, provided the sampling complexity $m\ge O(n \log^3 m)$,
where $n$ is the dimension of the underlying signals. In contrast to existing
work, our algorithms are regularization-free, requiring no truncation,
trimming, or additional penalty terms, and they permit the algorithm step sizes
as large as $O(1)$, compared to the $O(1/n)$ in previous literature.
Furthermore, our results accommodate arbitrary noise vectors that meet certain
statistical conditions, covering a wide range of noise scenarios, with
sub-exponential noise as a notable special case. The effectiveness of our
algorithms is validated through various numerical experiments. We emphasize
that our findings provide the first theoretical guarantees for recovering
non-peaky signals using non-convex methods from Bernoulli measurements, which
is of independent interest.

                                        <span>  In this article, we investigate a simple model of notched ferromagnetic
nanowires using tools from calculus of variations and critical point theory.
Specifically, we focus on the case of a single unimodal notch and establish the
existence and uniqueness of the critical point of the energy. This is achieved
through a lifting argument, which reduces the problem to a generalized
Sturm-Liouville equation. Uniqueness is demonstrated via a Mountain-Pass
argument, where the assumption of two distinct critical points leads to a
contradiction. Additionally, we show that the solution corresponds to a system
of magnetic spins characterized by a single domain wall localized in the
vicinity of the notch. We further analyze the asymptotic decay of the solution
at infinity and explore the symmetric case using rearrangement techniques.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we consider the Anderson acceleration method for solving the
contractive fixed point problem, which is nonsmooth in general. We define a
class of smoothing functions for the original nonsmooth fixed point mapping,
which can be easily formulated for many cases (see section3). Then, taking
advantage of the Anderson acceleration method, we proposed a Smoothing
Anderson(m) algorithm, in which we utilized a smoothing function of the
original nonsmooth fixed point mapping and update the smoothing parameter
adaptively. In theory, we first demonstrate the r-linear convergence of the
proposed Smoothing Anderson(m) algorithm for solving the considered nonsmooth
contractive fixed point problem with r-factor no larger than c, where c is the
contractive factor of the fixed point mapping. Second, we establish that both
of the Smoothing Anderson(1) and the Smoothing EDIIS(1) algorithms are q-linear
convergent with q-factor no larger than c. Finally, we present three numerical
examples with practical applications from elastic net regression, free boundary
problems for infinite journal bearings and non-negative least squares problem
to illustrate the better performance of the proposed Smoothing Anderson(m)
algorithm comparing with some popular methods.

presence of complex noise. Starting from the standard homoscedastic model,
various generalizations from the literature are presented: input varying noise
variance, non-Gaussian noise, or quantile modeling. These approaches are
compared in terms of goal, data availability and inference procedure. A
distinction is made between methods depending on their handling of repeated
observations at the same location, also called replication. The chapter
concludes with the corresponding adaptations of the sequential design
procedures. These are illustrated in an example from epidemiology.

                                        <span>  Physical models often contain unknown functions and relations. In order to
gain more insights into the nature of physical processes, these unknown
functions have to be identified or reconstructed. Mathematically, we can
formulate this research question within the framework of inverse problems. In
this work, we consider optimization techniques to solve the inverse problem
using Tikhonov regularization and data from laboratory experiments. We propose
an iterative strategy that eliminates the need for laboratory experiments. Our
method is applied to identify the coupling and damping coefficients in a system
of oscillators, ensuring an efficient and experiment-free approach. We present
our results and compare them with those obtained from an alternative, purely
experimental approach. By employing our proposed strategy, we demonstrate a
significant reduction in the number of laboratory experiments required.

stochastic differential game problem in which a single leader and multiple
followers are involved. We consider more practical formulation for partial
information that none of them can observed the complete information and the
followers know more than the leader. Some completely different methods
including orthogonal decomposition are applied to overcome the difficulties
caused by partially observability which improves the tools and relaxes the
constraint condition imposed on admissible control in the existing literature.
More precisely, the followers encounter the standard linear-quadratic partially
observed optimal control problems, however, a kind of forward-backward
indefinite linear-quadratic partially observed optimal control problem is
considered by the leader. Instead of maximum principle of forward-backward
control systems, inspired by the existing work related to definite case and
classical forward control system, some distinct forward-backward
linear-quadratic decoupling techniques including the completing the square
technique are applied to solve the leader's problem. More interestingly, we
develop the deterministic formation control in multi-agent system with a
framework of Stackelberg differential game and extend it to the stochastic
case. The optimal strategies are obtained by our theoretical result suitably.

                                        <span>  Trilevel learning (TLL) found diverse applications in numerous machine
learning applications, ranging from robust hyperparameter optimization to
domain adaptation. However, existing researches primarily focus on scenarios
where TLL can be addressed with first order information available at each
level, which is inadequate in many situations involving zeroth order
constraints, such as when black-box models are employed. Moreover, in trilevel
learning, data may be distributed across various nodes, necessitating
strategies to address TLL problems without centralizing data on servers to
uphold data privacy. To this end, an effective distributed trilevel zeroth
order learning framework DTZO is proposed in this work to address the TLL
problems with level-wise zeroth order constraints in a distributed manner. The
proposed DTZO is versatile and can be adapted to a wide range of (grey-box) TLL
problems with partial zeroth order constraints. In DTZO, the cascaded
polynomial approximation can be constructed without relying on gradients or
sub-gradients, leveraging a novel cut, i.e., zeroth order cut. Furthermore, we
theoretically carry out the non-asymptotic convergence rate analysis for the
proposed DTZO in achieving the $\epsilon$-stationary point. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to demonstrate and validate the superior
performance of the proposed DTZO, e.g., it approximately achieves up to a
40$\%$ improvement in performance.

sets in locally compact metric spaces. We explore foundational concepts,
including neighborhoods of compact sets, invariant sets, and the properties of
dynamical systems, and establish key results on the relationships between
attraction, invariance, and stability. The work explores Lyapunov stability
within the context of dynamical systems, highlighting equivalent formulations
and related criteria. Central to the exposition is a proof of the fundamental
theorem linking Lyapunov functions to the asymptotic stability of compact sets.
This expository piece consolidates results from several classical texts to
provide a unified and accessible framework for understanding stability in
metric spaces.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes a risk-averse approach to energy storage price arbitrage,
leveraging conformal uncertainty quantification for electricity price
predictions. The method addresses the significant challenges posed by the
inherent volatility and uncertainty of real-time electricity prices, which
create substantial risks of financial losses for energy storage participants
relying on future price forecasts to plan their operations. The framework
comprises a two-layer prediction model to quantify real-time price uncertainty
confidence intervals with high coverage. The framework is distribution-free and
can work with any underlying point prediction model. We evaluate the
quantification effectiveness through storage price arbitrage application by
managing the risk of participating in the real-time market. We design a
risk-averse policy for profit-maximization of energy storage arbitrage to find
the safest storage schedule with very minimal losses. Using historical data
from New York State and synthetic price predictions, our evaluations
demonstrate that this framework can achieve good profit margins with less than
$35\%$ purchases.

                                        <span>  We formulate and solve a Bayesian inverse Navier-Stokes (N-S) problem that
assimilates velocimetry data in order to jointly reconstruct a 3D flow field
and learn the unknown N-S parameters, including the boundary position. By
hardwiring a generalised N-S problem, and regularising its unknown parameters
using Gaussian prior distributions, we learn the most likely parameters in a
collapsed search space. The most likely flow field reconstruction is then the
N-S solution that corresponds to the learned parameters. We develop the method
in the variational setting and use a stabilised Nitsche weak form of the N-S
problem that permits the control of all N-S parameters. To regularise the
inferred the geometry, we use a viscous signed distance field (vSDF) as an
auxiliary variable, which is given as the solution of a viscous Eikonal
boundary value problem. We devise an algorithm that solves this inverse
problem, and numerically implement it using an adjoint-consistent stabilised
cut-cell finite element method. We then use this method to reconstruct magnetic
resonance velocimetry (flow-MRI) data of a 3D steady laminar flow through a
physical model of an aortic arch for two different Reynolds numbers and
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels (low/high). We find that the method can
accurately i) reconstruct the low SNR data by filtering out the noise/artefacts
and recovering flow features that are obscured by noise, and ii) reproduce the
high SNR data without overfitting. Although the framework that we develop
applies to 3D steady laminar flows in complex geometries, it readily extends to
time-dependent laminar and Reynolds-averaged turbulent flows, as well as
non-Newtonian (e.g. viscoelastic) fluids.

                                        <span>  Adaptive Waveform Inversion (AWI) applied to transient transmitted wave data
can yield estimates of index of refraction (or wave velocity) similar to those
obtained by travel time inversion. The AWI objective function measures
normalized mean-square dispersion about zero time of a family of filters, one
filter for each source-reeciver pair, designed to match predicted data to
observed data. Provided that the data contain a single smooth wavefront, this
function approaches the mean square traveltime error as data wavelength tends
to zero. The scaling of each filter to have unit norm is responsible for the
simple relation with travel time tomography. A similar approach, Matched Source
Waveform Inversion (MSWI), does not normalize the filters and has a looser
relation with mean-square travel time error. If substantial energy is spread
amongst multiple arrivals, on the other hand, neither AWI nor MSWI objectives
approximate the travel time mean square erorr, and attempts to minimize them by
local (Newton-related) optimization are as likely to stagnate at models
predicting erroneous travel times as is least-square Full Waveform Inversion
(FWI). The matching filter at the heart of this approach must be
``pre-whitened'', that is, computed by solving a regularized least squares
problem for filtered data misfit. In order for the relation to traveltime
tomography to hold, and for the filtered data misfit to stay relatively small,
the regularization weight must be coupled to data wavelength. These objective
functions can also be used as penalty terms in a homotopy of objectives
connecting AWI or MSWI with FWI.

Leader-Follower game with an ergodic criterion. The Receiver controls the
dynamics of a multidimensional unobserved state process. Information is
provided to the Receiver through a device designed by the Sender that generates
the observation process. The commitment of the Sender is enforced. We develop
this approach in the case where all dynamics are linear and the preferences of
the Receiver are linear-quadratic. We prove a verification theorem for the
existence and uniqueness of the solution of the HJB equation satisfied by the
Receiver's value function. An extension to the case of persuasion of a mean
field of interacting Receivers is also provided. We illustrate this approach in
two applications: the provision of information to electricity consumers with a
smart meter designed by an electricity producer; the information provided by
carbon footprint accounting rules to companies engaged in a best-in-class
emissions reduction effort. In the first application, we link the benefits of
information provision to the mispricing of electricity production. In the
latter, we show that information provision is a substitute for best-in-class
objective.

architecture inspired by the Thousand Brains Theory and Free Energy Principle
from cognitive sciences. In accordance with the neocortical (Neo) processes
postulated by the Thousand Brains Theory, Neo-FREE consists of functional units
returning control primitives. These are linearly combined by a gating mechanism
that minimizes the variational free energy (FREE). The problem of finding the
optimal primitives' weights is then recast as a finite-horizon optimal control
problem, which is convex even when the cost is not and the environment is
nonlinear, stochastic, non-stationary. The results yield an algorithm for
primitives composition and the effectiveness of Neo-FREE is illustrated via
in-silico and hardware experiments on an application involving robot navigation
in an environment with obstacles.

theoretical estimates of non-asymptotic learning rates which, unlike previous

pre-processing may be profitably leveraged to enable efficient numerical
implementation, offering excellent balance between precision and computational

distributions over Y? Looking at measure-valued maps can be interpreted as
knowing a classical map with uncertainty, and from an optimization point of
view the main gain is the convexification of Y into P(Y). We will explain why
trying to single out the largest convex lifting amounts to solve an optimal
transport problem with an infinity of marginals which can be interesting by
itself. Moreover we will show that, to recover previously proposed liftings for
functionals depending on the Jacobian of the map, one needs to add a
restriction of additivity to the lifted functional.

                                        <span>  The proliferation of space debris in LEO has become a major concern for the
space industry. With the growing interest in space exploration, the prediction
of potential collisions between objects in orbit has become a crucial issue. It
is estimated that, in orbit, there are millions of fragments a few millimeters
in size and thousands of inoperative satellites and discarded rocket stages.
Given the high speeds that these fragments can reach, even fragments a few
millimeters in size can cause fractures in a satellite's hull or put a serious
crack in the window of a space shuttle. The conventional method proposed by
Akella and Alfriend in 2000 remains widely used to estimate the probability of
collision in short-term encounters. Given the small period of time, it is
assumed that, during the encounter: (1) trajectories are represented by
straight lines with constant velocity; (2) there is no velocity uncertainty and
the position exhibits a stationary distribution throughout the encounter; and
(3) position uncertainties are independent and represented by Gaussian
distributions. This study introduces a novel derivation based on first
principles that naturally allows for tight and fast upper and lower bounds for
the probability of collision. We tested implementations of both probability and
bound computations with the original and our formulation on a real CDM dataset
used in ESA's Collision Avoidance Challenge. Our approach reduces the
calculation of the probability to two one-dimensional integrals and has the
potential to significantly reduce the processing time compared to the
traditional method, from 80% to nearly real-time.

decision-making problems and are widely used across many scientific areas,
including formal methods and artificial intelligence (AI). MDPs do, however,
come with the restrictive assumption that the transition probabilities need to
be precisely known. Robust MDPs (RMDPs) overcome this assumption by instead
defining the transition probabilities to belong to some uncertainty set. We
present a gentle survey on RMDPs, providing a tutorial covering their
fundamentals. In particular, we discuss RMDP semantics and how to solve them by
extending standard MDP methods such as value iteration and policy iteration. We
also discuss how RMDPs relate to other models and how they are used in several
contexts, including reinforcement learning and abstraction techniques. We
conclude with some challenges for future work on RMDPs.

mathematical language. Source codes and a demo are provided online.

                                        <span>  Cutting planes (cuts) are crucial for solving Mixed Integer Linear
Programming (MILP) problems. Advanced MILP solvers typically rely on manually
designed heuristic algorithms for cut selection, which require much expert
experience and cannot be generalized for different scales of MILP problems.
Therefore, learning-based methods for cut selection are considered a promising
direction. State-of-the-art learning-based methods formulate cut selection as a
sequence-to-sequence problem, easily handled by sequence models. However, the
existing sequence models need help with the following issues: (1) the model
only captures cut information while neglecting the Linear Programming (LP)
relaxation; (2) the sequence model utilizes positional information of the input
sequence, which may influence cut selection. To address these challenges, we
design a novel learning model HGTSM for better select cuts. We encode MILP
problem state as a heterogeneous tripartite graph, utilizing heterogeneous
graph networks to fully capture the underlying structure of MILP problems.
Simultaneously, we propose a novel sequence model whose architecture is
tailored to handle inputs in different orders. Experimental results demonstrate
that our model outperforms heuristic methods and learning-based baselines on
multiple challenging MILP datasets. Additionally, the model exhibits stability
and the ability to generalize to different types of problems.

function over a nonempty closed set. The conditions require an asymptotically
bounded decay of a function, a relaxation of p-supercoercivity, and a certain
relation for the asymptotic cone of the constraint set and the asymptotic
function of the objective function. Our analysis combines these conditions with
a regularization technique. We refine the notion of retractive directions of a
set, extend its definition to functions, and establish some basic relations for
such directions for both sets and functions. Using these tools, we provide
existence of solutions results that generalize many of the results in the
literature for both non-convex and convex problems.

the sparse-feedback gain is investigated to minimize the modified

investigated, which exhibits an accelerated convergence rate. Third,

management, statistical estimation, and optimization. Distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) based on $\varphi$-divergence minimizes the maximal expected
loss, where the maximum is over a $\varphi$-divergence ambiguity set. This
paper introduces the \emph{extended} $\varphi$-divergence and the extended
$\varphi$-divergence quadrangle, which integrates DRO into the FRQ framework.
We derive the primal and dual representations of the quadrangle elements (risk,
deviation, regret, error, and statistic). The dual representation provides an
interpretation of classification, portfolio optimization, and regression as
robust optimization based on the extended $\varphi$-divergence. The primal
representation offers tractable formulations of these robust optimizations as
convex optimization. We provide illustrative examples showing that many common
problems, such as least-squares regression, quantile regression, support vector
machines, and CVaR optimization, fall within this framework. Additionally, we
conduct a case study to visualize the optimal solution of the inner
maximization in robust optimization.

                                        <span>  This paper presents the concept of an equivalence relation between the set of
optimal control problems. By leveraging this concept, we show that the boundary
of the reachability set can be constructed by the solutions of time optimal
problems. Alongside, a more generalized equivalence theorem is presented
together. The findings facilitate the use of solution structures from a certain
class of optimal control problems to address problems in corresponding
equivalent classes. As a byproduct, we state and prove the construction methods
of the reachability sets of three-dimensional curves with prescribed curvature
bound. The findings are twofold: Firstly, we prove that any boundary point of
the reachability set, with the terminal direction taken into account, can be
accessed via curves of H, CSC, CCC, or their respective subsegments, where H
denotes a helicoidal arc, C a circular arc with maximum curvature, and S a
straight segment. Secondly, we show that any boundary point of the reachability
set, without considering the terminal direction, can be accessed by curves of
CC, CS, or their respective subsegments. These findings extend the developments
presented in literature regarding planar curves, or Dubins car dynamics, into
spatial curves in $\mathbb{R}^3$. For higher dimensions, we confirm that the
problem of identifying the reachability set of curvature bounded paths subsumes
the well-known Markov-Dubins problem. These advancements in understanding the
reachability of curvature bounded paths in $\mathbb{R}^3$ hold significant
practical implications, particularly in the contexts of mission planning
problems and time optimal guidance.

                                        <span>  The theory of mixed-feedback systems provides an effective framework for the
design of robust and tunable oscillations in nonlinear systems characterized by
interleaved fast positive and slow negative feedback loops. The goal of this
paper is to extend the mixed-feedback oscillation design framework to networks.
To this aim, we introduce a network model of coupled mixed-feedback systems,
ask under which conditions it exhibits a collective oscillatory rhythm, and if,
and how, this rhythm can be shaped by network design. In the proposed network
model, node dynamics are nonlinear and defined by a tractable realization of
the mixed-feedback structure. Coupling between nodes is also nonlinear and
defined by a tractable abstraction of synaptic coupling between neurons. We
derive constructive conditions under which the spectral properties of the
network adjacency matrix fully and explicitly determine both the emergence of a
stable network rhythm and its detailed rhythmic profile, i.e., the pattern of
relative oscillation amplitudes and phase differences. Our theoretical
developments are grounded on ideas from dominant systems and bifurcation
theory. They provide a new framework for the analysis and design of nonlinear
network rhythms.

                                        <span>  Traditional robotic manipulation mostly focuses on collision-free tasks. In
practice, however, many manipulation tasks (e.g., occluded object grasping)
require the robot to intentionally collide with the environment to reach a
desired task configuration. By enabling compliant robot motions, collisions
between the robot and the environment are allowed and can thus be exploited,
but more physical uncertainties are introduced. To address collision-rich
problems such as occluded object grasping while handling the involved
uncertainties, we propose a collision-inclusive planning framework that can
transition the robot to a desired task configuration via roughly modeled
collisions absorbed by Cartesian impedance control. By strategically exploiting
the environmental constraints and exploring inside a manipulation funnel formed
by task repetitions, our framework can effectively reduce physical and
perception uncertainties. With real-world evaluations on both single-arm and
dual-arm setups, we show that our framework is able to efficiently address
various realistic occluded grasping problems where a feasible grasp does not
initially exist.

intelligence, but it's now known that many other animals, like crows, possess
this capability. Yet, robotic systems still fall short of matching biological
dexterity. In this paper, we investigate the use of Large Language Models
(LLMs), tool affordances, and object manoeuvrability for non-prehensile
tool-based manipulation tasks. Our novel method leverages LLMs based on scene
information and natural language instructions to enable symbolic task planning
for tool-object manipulation. This approach allows the system to convert the
human language sentence into a sequence of feasible motion functions. We have
developed a novel manoeuvrability-driven controller using a new tool affordance
model derived from visual feedback. This controller helps guide the robot's
tool utilization and manipulation actions, even within confined areas, using a
stepping incremental approach. The proposed methodology is evaluated with
experiments to prove its effectiveness under various manipulation scenarios.

magnetic devices (UMDs), such as microrobots and nanorobots, is the continuous
demand to manipulate, sort, and assemble micro-objects with high level of
accuracy and dexterity. UMDs can function as microgrippers or manipulators and
move micro-objects with or without direct contact. In this case, the UMDs can
be directly teleoperated by an operator using haptic tele-manipulation systems.
The aim of this chapter is threefold: first, to provide a mathematical
framework to design a scaled bilateral tele-manipulation system to achieve
wireless actuation of micro-objects using magnetically-guided UMDs; second, to
demonstrate closed-loop stability based on absolute stability theory; third, to
provide experimental case studies performed on haptic devices to manipulate
microrobots and assemble micro-objects. In this chapter, we are concerned with
some fundamental concepts of electromagnetics and low-Reynolds number
hydrodynamics to understand the stability and performance of haptic devices in
micro- and nano-manipulation applications.

environmental conditions and object instances remains a fundamental challenge
in robot learning. While considerable efforts have focused on collecting large
robot datasets and developing policy architectures to learn from such data,
naively learning from visual inputs often results in brittle policies that fail
to transfer beyond the training data. This work presents Prescriptive Point
Priors for Policies or P3-PO, a novel framework that constructs a unique state
representation of the environment leveraging recent advances in computer vision
and robot learning to achieve improved out-of-distribution generalization for
robot manipulation. This representation is obtained through two steps. First, a
human annotator prescribes a set of semantically meaningful points on a single
demonstration frame. These points are then propagated through the dataset using
off-the-shelf vision models. The derived points serve as an input to
state-of-the-art policy architectures for policy learning. Our experiments
across four real-world tasks demonstrate an overall 43% absolute improvement
over prior methods when evaluated in identical settings as training. Further,
P3-PO exhibits 58% and 80% gains across tasks for new object instances and more
cluttered environments respectively. Videos illustrating the robot's
performance are best viewed at point-priors.github.io.

                                        <span>  In robotic visuomotor policy learning, diffusion-based models have achieved
significant success in improving the accuracy of action trajectory generation
compared to traditional autoregressive models. However, they suffer from
inefficiency due to multiple denoising steps and limited flexibility from
complex constraints. In this paper, we introduce Coarse-to-Fine AutoRegressive
Policy (CARP), a novel paradigm for visuomotor policy learning that redefines
the autoregressive action generation process as a coarse-to-fine, next-scale
approach. CARP decouples action generation into two stages: first, an action
autoencoder learns multi-scale representations of the entire action sequence;
then, a GPT-style transformer refines the sequence prediction through a
coarse-to-fine autoregressive process. This straightforward and intuitive
approach produces highly accurate and smooth actions, matching or even
surpassing the performance of diffusion-based policies while maintaining
efficiency on par with autoregressive policies. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse settings, including single-task and multi-task
scenarios on state-based and image-based simulation benchmarks, as well as
real-world tasks. CARP achieves competitive success rates, with up to a 10%
improvement, and delivers 10x faster inference compared to state-of-the-art
policies, establishing a high-performance, efficient, and flexible paradigm for
action generation in robotic tasks.

                                        <span>  Performing general language-conditioned bimanual manipulation tasks is of
great importance for many applications ranging from household service to
industrial assembly. However, collecting bimanual manipulation data is
expensive due to the high-dimensional action space, which poses challenges for
conventional methods to handle general bimanual manipulation tasks. In
contrast, unimanual policy has recently demonstrated impressive
generalizability across a wide range of tasks because of scaled model
parameters and training data, which can provide sharable manipulation knowledge
for bimanual systems. To this end, we propose a plug-and-play method named
AnyBimanual, which transfers pre-trained unimanual policy to general bimanual
manipulation policy with few bimanual demonstrations. Specifically, we first
introduce a skill manager to dynamically schedule the skill representations
discovered from pre-trained unimanual policy for bimanual manipulation tasks,
which linearly combines skill primitives with task-oriented compensation to
represent the bimanual manipulation instruction. To mitigate the observation
discrepancy between unimanual and bimanual systems, we present a visual aligner
to generate soft masks for visual embedding of the workspace, which aims to
align visual input of unimanual policy model for each arm with those during
pretraining stage. AnyBimanual shows superiority on 12 simulated tasks from
RLBench2 with a sizable 12.67% improvement in success rate over previous
methods. Experiments on 9 real-world tasks further verify its practicality with
an average success rate of 84.62%.

                                        <span>  Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages for real-time perception in
dynamic environments, thanks to their microsecond-level temporal resolution and
asynchronous operation. Existing event-based object detection methods, however,
are limited by fixed-frequency paradigms and fail to fully exploit the
high-temporal resolution and adaptability of event cameras. To address these
limitations, we propose FlexEvent, a novel event camera object detection
framework that enables detection at arbitrary frequencies. Our approach
consists of two key components: FlexFuser, an adaptive event-frame fusion
module that integrates high-frequency event data with rich semantic information
from RGB frames, and FAL, a frequency-adaptive learning mechanism that
generates frequency-adjusted labels to enhance model generalization across
varying operational frequencies. This combination allows our method to detect
objects with high accuracy in both fast-moving and static scenarios, while
adapting to dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on large-scale event
camera datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art
methods, achieving significant improvements in both standard and high-frequency
settings. Notably, our method maintains robust performance when scaling from 20
Hz to 90 Hz and delivers accurate detection up to 180 Hz, proving its
effectiveness in extreme conditions. Our framework sets a new benchmark for
event-based object detection and paves the way for more adaptable, real-time
vision systems.

complex layouts is a challenging task, with objects of a wide variation of
geometries and articulation under scenarios with various obstacles. The main
difficulty lies in the sparsity of the motion data compared to the wide
variation of the objects and environments as well as the poor availability of
transition motions between different tasks, increasing the complexity of the
generalization to arbitrary conditions. To cope with this issue, we develop a
system that tackles the interaction synthesis problem as a hierarchical
goal-driven task. Firstly, we develop a bimanual scheduler that plans a set of
keyframes for simultaneously controlling the two hands to efficiently achieve
the pick-and-place task from an abstract goal signal such as the target object
selected by the user. Next, we develop a neural implicit planner that generates
guidance hand trajectories under diverse object shape/types and obstacle
layouts. Finally, we propose a linear dynamic model for our DeepPhase
controller that incorporates a Kalman filter to enable smooth transitions in
the frequency domain, resulting in a more realistic and effective
multi-objective control of the character.Our system can produce a wide range of
natural pick-and-place movements with respect to the geometry of objects, the
articulation of containers and the layout of the objects in the scene.

investigate a mixed strategy in MF training that first pre-train motion
forecasters on pseudo-labeled data, then fine-tune them on annotated data. To
obtain pseudo-labeled trajectories, we propose a simple pipeline that leverages
off-the-shelf single-frame 3D object detectors and non-learning trackers. The
whole pre-training strategy including pseudo-labeling is coined as PPT. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) combining PPT with supervised
fine-tuning on annotated data achieves superior performance on diverse

multiple datasets improves the previous state-of-the-art and (3) PPT helps
enhance cross-dataset generalization. Our findings showcase PPT as a promising

                                        <span>  Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) is a visual localization technique that
utilizes deep neural networks (DNN) to directly regress 2D-3D correspondences
for camera pose estimation. However, current SCR methods often face challenges
in handling repetitive textures and meaningless areas due to their reliance on
implicit triangulation. In this paper, we propose an efficient scene coordinate
encoding and relocalization method. Compared with the existing SCR methods, we
design a unified architecture for both scene encoding and salient keypoint
detection, enabling our system to focus on encoding informative regions,
thereby significantly enhancing efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a
mechanism that leverages sequential information during both map encoding and
relocalization, which strengthens implicit triangulation, particularly in
repetitive texture environments. Comprehensive experiments conducted across
indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms
other state-of-the-art (SOTA) SCR methods. Our single-frame relocalization mode
improves the recall rate of our baseline by 6.4% and increases the running
speed from 56Hz to 90Hz. Furthermore, our sequence-based mode increases the
recall rate by 11% while maintaining the original efficiency.

                                        <span>  Surgical workflow anticipation is the task of predicting the timing of
relevant surgical events from live video data, which is critical in
Robotic-Assisted Surgery (RAS). Accurate predictions require the use of spatial
information to model surgical interactions. However, current methods focus
solely on surgical instruments, assume static interactions between instruments,
and only anticipate surgical events within a fixed time horizon. To address
these challenges, we propose an adaptive graph learning framework for surgical
workflow anticipation based on a novel spatial representation, featuring three
key innovations. First, we introduce a new representation of spatial
information based on bounding boxes of surgical instruments and targets,
including their detection confidence levels. These are trained on additional
annotations we provide for two benchmark datasets. Second, we design an
adaptive graph learning method to capture dynamic interactions. Third, we
develop a multi-horizon objective that balances learning objectives for
different time horizons, allowing for unconstrained predictions. Evaluations on
two benchmarks reveal superior performance in short-to-mid-term anticipation,
with an error reduction of approximately 3% for surgical phase anticipation and
9% for remaining surgical duration anticipation. These performance improvements
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and highlight its potential for
enhancing preparation and coordination within the RAS team. This can improve
surgical safety and the efficiency of operating room usage.

                                        <span>  In warehousing systems, to enhance logistical efficiency amid surging demand
volumes, much focus is placed on how to reasonably allocate tasks to robots.
However, the robots labor is still inevitably wasted to some extent. In
response to this, we propose a pre-scheduling enhanced warehousing framework
that predicts task flow and acts in advance. It consists of task flow
prediction and hybrid tasks allocation. For task prediction, we notice that it
is possible to provide a spatio-temporal representation of task flow, so we
introduce a periodicity-decoupled mechanism tailored for the generation
patterns of aggregated orders, and then further extract spatial features of
task distribution with novel combination of graph structures.
  In hybrid tasks allocation, we consider the known tasks and predicted future
tasks simultaneously and optimize the allocation dynamically. In addition, we
consider factors such as predicted task uncertainty and sector-level efficiency
evaluation in warehousing to realize more balanced and rational allocations. We
validate our task prediction model across actual datasets derived from real
factories, achieving SOTA performance. Furthermore, we implement our compelte
scheduling system in a real-world robotic warehouse for months of lifelong
validation, demonstrating large improvements in key metrics of warehousing,
such as empty running rate, by more than 50%.

                                        <span>  This paper investigates the problem of trajectory planning for autonomous
vehicles at unsignalized intersections, specifically focusing on scenarios
where the vehicle lacks the right of way and yet must cross safely. To address
this issue, we have employed a method based on the Partially Observable Markov
Decision Processes (POMDPs) framework designed for planning under uncertainty.
The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm as an approximate
solver for the POMDPs. We outline the POMDP formulation, beginning with
discretizing the intersection's topology. Additionally, we present a dynamics
model for the prediction of the evolving states of vehicles, such as their
position and velocity. Using an observation model, we also describe the
connection of those states with the imperfect (noisy) available measurements.
Our results confirmed that the method is able to plan collision-free
trajectories in a series of simulations utilizing real-world traffic data from
aerial footage of two distinct intersections. Furthermore, we studied the
impact of parameter adjustments of the ABT algorithm on the method's
performance. This provides guidance in determining reasonable parameter
settings, which is valuable for future method applications.

payload. To address this challenge, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics
(SINDy) is used to obtain the governing equation of the multirotor system. The
SINDy can discover the equations of target systems with low data, assuming that
few functions have the dominant characteristic of the system. Model predictive
control (MPC) is utilized to obtain accurate trajectory tracking performance by
considering state and control input constraints. To avoid a collision during
operation, MPC optimization problem is again formulated using inequality
constraints about an obstacle. In simulation, SINDy can discover a governing
equation of multirotor system including mass parameter uncertainty and
aerodynamic effects. In addition, the simulation results show that the proposed
method has the capability to avoid an obstacle and track the desired trajectory
accurately.

This makes them highly suitable for resource-restricted, agile robots such as
small flying drones. Self-supervised learning based on contrast maximization
holds great potential for event-based robot vision, as it foregoes the need to
high-frequency ground truth and allows for online learning in the robot's

challenge of achieving sufficient computational efficiency for real-time

Finally, we compare the performance of different combinations of pre-training

avoidance in complex and unknown environments is critical for applications in
agricultural irrigation, disaster relief and logistics. In this paper, we
propose the DPRL (Distributed Privileged Reinforcement Learning) navigation
algorithm, an end-to-end policy designed to address the challenge of high-speed
autonomous UAV navigation under partially observable environmental conditions.
Our approach combines deep reinforcement learning with privileged learning to
overcome the impact of observation data corruption caused by partial
observability. We leverage an asymmetric Actor-Critic architecture to provide
the agent with privileged information during training, which enhances the
model's perceptual capabilities. Additionally, we present a multi-agent

collection, which in turn expedites model convergence. We conducted extensive

the state-of-the-art navigation algorithms. The results consistently

numerous applications, including environmental monitoring, disaster response,
and agricultural surveying. Enhancing the collective behavior of multiple
decentralized UAVs can significantly improve these applications through more
efficient and coordinated operations. In this study, we explore a Recurrent PPO
model for target localization in perceptually degraded environments like places
without GNSS/GPS signals. We first developed a single-drone approach for target
identification, followed by a decentralized two-drone model. Our approach can
utilize two types of sensors on the UAVs, a detection sensor and a target
signal sensor. The single-drone model achieved an accuracy of 93%, while the
two-drone model achieved an accuracy of 86%, with the latter requiring fewer
average steps to locate the target. This demonstrates the potential of our
method in UAV swarms, offering efficient and effective localization of radiant
targets in complex environmental conditions.

interaction demands, such as following instructions, searching objects,
answering questions, tracking people, and more. Existing models for embodied
navigation fall short of serving as practical generalists in the real world, as
they are often constrained by specific task configurations or pre-defined maps
with discretized waypoints. In this work, we present Uni-NaVid, the first
video-based vision-language-action (VLA) model designed to unify diverse
embodied navigation tasks and enable seamless navigation for mixed long-horizon
tasks in unseen real-world environments. Uni-NaVid achieves this by harmonizing
the input and output data configurations for all commonly used embodied
navigation tasks and thereby integrating all tasks in one model. For training
Uni-NaVid, we collect 3.6 million navigation data samples in total from four
essential navigation sub-tasks and foster synergy in learning across them.
Extensive experiments on comprehensive navigation benchmarks clearly
demonstrate the advantages of unification modeling in Uni-NaVid and show it
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, real-world experiments
confirm the model's effectiveness and efficiency, shedding light on its strong
generalizability.

interest for their expressivity, but solutions rely on linear approximations.
We approach the problem of driving the state of a dynamical system in
distribution from a sequential decision-making perspective. We formulate the
optimal control problem as an appropriate Markov decision process (MDP), where
the actions correspond to the state-feedback control policies. We then solve
the MDP using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). This renders our method suitable
for any dynamics model. A key component of our approach is a novel, easy to
compute, distance metric in the distribution space that allows our algorithm to
guide the distribution of the state. We experimentally test our algorithm under
both linear and nonlinear dynamics.

                                        <span>  Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become standard tools in
reconnaissance and surveying for both civilian and defense applications. In the
future, UAVs will likely play a pivotal role in autonomous package delivery,
but current multi-rotor candidates suffer from poor energy efficiency leading
to insufficient endurance and range. In order to reduce the power demands of
package delivery UAVs while still maintaining necessary hovering capabilities,
companies like Amazon are experimenting with hybrid Vertical Take-Off and
Landing (VTOL) platforms. Tailsitter VTOLs offer a mechanically simple and
cost-effective solution compared to other hybrid VTOL configurations, and while
advances in hardware and microelectronics have optimized the tailsitter for
package delivery, the software behind its operation has largely remained a
critical barrier to industry adoption. Tailsitters currently lack a generic,
computationally efficient method of control that can provide strong safety and
robustness guarantees over the entire flight domain. Further, tailsitters lack
a closed-form method of designing dynamically feasible transition maneuvers
between hover and cruise. In this paper, we survey the modeling and control
methods currently implemented on small-scale tailsitter UAVs, and attempt to
leverage a nonlinear dynamic model to design physically realizable,
continuous-pitch transition maneuvers at constant altitude. Primary results
from this paper isolate potential barriers to constant-altitude transition, and
a novel approach to bypassing these barriers is proposed. While initial results
are unsuccessful at providing feasible transition, this work acts as a stepping
stone for future efforts to design new transition maneuvers that are safe,
robust, and computationally efficient.

as moving ships or buoys, which become obstacles under the influence of waves.
In such challenging conditions, the ability to detect and track potentially
hazardous objects is critical for the safe navigation of marine robots. To
address the scarcity of comprehensive datasets capturing these dynamic
scenarios, we introduce a new multi-modal dataset that includes image and
point-wise annotations of maritime hazards. Our dataset provides detailed
ground truth for obstacle detection and tracking, including objects as small as
10$\times$10 pixels, which are crucial for maritime safety. To validate the
dataset's effectiveness as a reliable benchmark, we conducted evaluations using
various methodologies, including \ac{SOTA} techniques for object detection and
tracking. These evaluations are expected to contribute to performance
improvements, particularly in the complex maritime environment. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first dataset offering multi-modal annotations
specifically tailored to maritime environments. Our dataset is available at

leverage shared information across connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and
smart infrastructures to address sensing occlusion and range limitation issues.
However, existing research overlooks the fragile multi-sensor correlations in
multi-agent settings, as the heterogeneous agent sensor measurements are highly
susceptible to environmental factors, leading to weakened inter-agent sensor
interactions. The varying operational conditions and other real-world factors
inevitably introduce multifactorial noise and consequentially lead to
multi-sensor misalignment, making the deployment of multi-agent multi-modality
perception particularly challenging in the real world. In this paper, we
propose AgentAlign, a real-world heterogeneous agent cross-modality feature
alignment framework, to effectively address these multi-modality misalignment
issues. Our method introduces a cross-modality feature alignment space (CFAS)
and heterogeneous agent feature alignment (HAFA) mechanism to harmonize
multi-modality features across various agents dynamically. Additionally, we
present a novel V2XSet-noise dataset that simulates realistic sensor
imperfections under diverse environmental conditions, facilitating a systematic
evaluation of our approach's robustness. Extensive experiments on the V2X-Real
and V2XSet-Noise benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its potential for real-world
applications in cooperative autonomous driving. The controllable V2XSet-Noise
dataset and generation pipeline will be released in the future.

accuracy of virtual reality (VR) headsets, utilizing a cooperative industrial
robot to simulate user head trajectories in a reproducible manner. We conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of two popular VR headsets, i.e., Meta Quest 2 and
Meta Quest Pro. Using head movement trajectories captured from realistic VR

devices exhibit high positioning accuracy, with no significant differences
between them. These findings may provide insights for developers and
researchers seeking to optimize their VR experiences in particular contexts

                                        <span>  We introduce Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization, DPPO, an algorithmic
framework including best practices for fine-tuning diffusion-based policies
(e.g. Diffusion Policy) in continuous control and robot learning tasks using
the policy gradient (PG) method from reinforcement learning (RL). PG methods
are ubiquitous in training RL policies with other policy parameterizations;
nevertheless, they had been conjectured to be less efficient for
diffusion-based policies. Surprisingly, we show that DPPO achieves the
strongest overall performance and efficiency for fine-tuning in common
benchmarks compared to other RL methods for diffusion-based policies and also
compared to PG fine-tuning of other policy parameterizations. Through
experimental investigation, we find that DPPO takes advantage of unique
synergies between RL fine-tuning and the diffusion parameterization, leading to
structured and on-manifold exploration, stable training, and strong policy
robustness. We further demonstrate the strengths of DPPO in a range of
realistic settings, including simulated robotic tasks with pixel observations,
and via zero-shot deployment of simulation-trained policies on robot hardware
in a long-horizon, multi-stage manipulation task. Website with code:

                                        <span>  We consider large-scale, implicit-search-based solutions to Shortest Path
Problems on Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS). We propose GCS*, a forward heuristic
search algorithm that generalizes A* search to the GCS setting, where a
continuous-valued decision is made at each graph vertex, and constraints across
graph edges couple these decisions, influencing costs and feasibility. Such
mixed discrete-continuous planning is needed in many domains, including motion
planning around obstacles and planning through contact. This setting provides a
unique challenge for best-first search algorithms: the cost and feasibility of
a path depend on continuous-valued points chosen along the entire path. We show
that by pruning paths that are cost-dominated over their entire terminal
vertex, GCS* can search efficiently while still guaranteeing cost-optimality
and completeness. To find satisficing solutions quickly, we also present a
complete but suboptimal variation, pruning instead reachability-dominated
paths. We implement these checks using polyhedral-containment or sampling-based
methods. The former implementation is complete and cost-optimal, while the
latter is probabilistically complete and asymptotically cost-optimal and
performs effectively even with minimal samples in practice. We demonstrate GCS*
on planar pushing tasks where the combinatorial explosion of contact modes
renders prior methods intractable and show it performs favorably compared to
the state-of-the-art. Project website: https://shaoyuan.cc/research/gcs-star/

                                        <span>  Automatic detection and prevention of open-set failures are crucial in
closed-loop robotic systems. Recent studies often struggle to simultaneously
identify unexpected failures reactively after they occur and prevent
foreseeable ones proactively. To this end, we propose Code-as-Monitor (CaM), a
novel paradigm leveraging the vision-language model (VLM) for both open-set
reactive and proactive failure detection. The core of our method is to
formulate both tasks as a unified set of spatio-temporal constraint
satisfaction problems and use VLM-generated code to evaluate them for real-time
monitoring. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring, we further
introduce constraint elements that abstract constraint-related entities or
their parts into compact geometric elements. This approach offers greater
generality, simplifies tracking, and facilitates constraint-aware visual
programming by leveraging these elements as visual prompts. Experiments show
that CaM achieves a 28.7% higher success rate and reduces execution time by
31.8% under severe disturbances compared to baselines across three simulators
and a real-world setting. Moreover, CaM can be integrated with open-loop
control policies to form closed-loop systems, enabling long-horizon tasks in
cluttered scenes with dynamic environments.

into contact placement predictions; it also deals with iterative corrections,
until the human is satisfied with the contact location identified in the
robot's field of view. We benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs and VLMs for size and

iterative correction process, showing that users, even naive, quickly learn how
to instruct the system to obtain accurate locations. Finally, we validate
Words2Contact in real-world experiments with the Talos humanoid robot,
instructed by human operators to place support contacts on different locations
and surfaces to avoid falling when reaching for distant objects.

                                        <span>  When planning for autonomous driving, it is crucial to consider essential
traffic elements such as lanes, intersections, traffic regulations, and dynamic
agents. However, they are often overlooked by the traditional end-to-end
planning methods, likely leading to inefficiencies and non-compliance with
traffic regulations. In this work, we endeavor to integrate the perception of
these elements into the planning task. To this end, we propose Perception Helps
Planning (PHP), a novel framework that reconciles lane-level planning with
perception. This integration ensures that planning is inherently aligned with
traffic constraints, thus facilitating safe and efficient driving.
Specifically, PHP focuses on both edges of a lane for planning and perception
purposes, taking into consideration the 3D positions of both lane edges and
attributes for lane intersections, lane directions, lane occupancy, and
planning. In the algorithmic design, the process begins with the transformer
encoding multi-camera images to extract the above features and predicting
lane-level perception results. Next, the hierarchical feature early fusion
module refines the features for predicting planning attributes. Finally, the
double-edge interpreter utilizes a late-fusion process specifically designed to
integrate lane-level perception and planning information, culminating in the
generation of vehicle control signals. Experiments on three Carla benchmarks
show significant improvements in driving score of 27.20%, 33.47%, and 15.54%
over existing algorithms, respectively, achieving the state-of-the-art
performance, with the system operating up to 22.57 FPS.

                                        <span>  Learning complex trajectories from demonstrations in robotic tasks has been
effectively addressed through the utilization of Dynamical Systems (DS).
State-of-the-art DS learning methods ensure stability of the generated
trajectories; however, they have three shortcomings: a) the DS is assumed to
have a single attractor, which limits the diversity of tasks it can achieve, b)
state derivative information is assumed to be available in the learning process
and c) the state of the DS is assumed to be measurable at inference time. We
propose a class of provably stable latent DS with possibly multiple attractors,
that inherit the training methods of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations,
thus, dropping the dependency on state derivative information. A diffeomorphic
mapping for the output and a loss that captures time-invariant trajectory
similarity are proposed. We validate the efficacy of our approach through
experiments conducted on a public dataset of handwritten shapes and within a
simulated object manipulation task.

                                        <span>  Distance functions are crucial in robotics for representing spatial
relationships between the robot and the environment. It provides an implicit
representation of continuous and differentiable shapes, which can seamlessly be
combined with control, optimization, and learning techniques. While standard
distance fields rely on the Euclidean metric, many robotic tasks inherently
involve non-Euclidean structures. To this end, we generalize the use of
Euclidean distance fields to more general metric spaces by solving a Riemannian
eikonal equation, a first-order partial differential equation, whose solution
defines a distance field and its associated gradient flow on the manifold,
enabling the computation of geodesics and globally length-minimizing paths. We
show that this \emph{geodesic distance field} can also be exploited in the
robot configuration space. To realize this concept, we exploit physics-informed
neural networks to solve the eikonal equation for high-dimensional spaces,
which provides a flexible and scalable representation without the need for
discretization. Furthermore, a variant of our neural eikonal solver is
introduced, which enables the gradient flow to march across both task and
configuration spaces. As an example of application, we validate the proposed
approach in an energy-aware motion generation task. This is achieved by
considering a manifold defined by a Riemannian metric in configuration space,
effectively taking the property of the robot's dynamics into account. Our
approach produces minimal-energy trajectories for a 7-axis Franka robot by
iteratively tracking geodesics through gradient flow backpropagation.

forecasting in autonomous driving. However, efficiently capturing these
trajectories in a compact set remains challenging. This study introduces a
novel approach for generating scene-specific trajectory sets tailored to
different contexts, such as intersections and straight roads, by leveraging map
information and actor dynamics. A deterministic goal sampling algorithm
identifies relevant map regions, while our Recursive In-Distribution
Subsampling (RIDS) method enhances trajectory plausibility by condensing
redundant representations. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves up to a 10% improvement in Driving Area Compliance
(DAC) compared to baseline methods while maintaining competitive displacement
errors. Our work highlights the benefits of mining such scene-aware trajectory
sets and how they could capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of actor
behavior in real-world driving scenarios.

crucial component in various autonomous agent systems. While traditional
methods depend on the inherent knowledge of LLMs without fine-tuning, more
recent approaches have shifted toward the reinforcement learning strategy to
further enhance agents' ability to solve complex interactive tasks with
environments and tools. However, previous approaches are constrained by the
sparse reward issue, where existing datasets solely provide a final scalar
reward for each multi-step reasoning chain, potentially leading to
ineffectiveness and inefficiency in policy learning. In this paper, we
introduce StepAgent, which utilizes step-wise reward to optimize the agent's
reinforcement learning process. Inheriting the spirit of novice-to-expert
theory, we first compare the actions of the expert and the agent to
automatically generate intermediate rewards for fine-grained optimization.
Additionally, we propose implicit-reward and inverse reinforcement learning
techniques to facilitate agent reflection and policy adjustment. Further
theoretical analysis demonstrates that the action distribution of the agent can
converge toward the expert action distribution over multiple training cycles.
Experimental results across various datasets indicate that StepAgent
outperforms existing baseline methods.

unpredicted environmental factors and existing technological barriers. The
challenges encountered often result in fluctuating energy outputs, hindering
the transition to greener energy solutions. To tackle these issues, this study
introduces a custom-designed Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) controller,
seamlessly incorporated into a microcontroller-based battery charging system.
This approach seeks to enhance the efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) systems,
aligning with the global shift towards renewables. The research's primary
objective is to enhance PV module power yield employing MPPT techniques,
thereby reducing dependency on non-renewable energy sources. Key goals include
real-time MPP tracking for optimal power extraction from PV modules and the
integration of a real-time monitoring mechanism for PV and battery states.
Leveraging a coordinated interplay of sensors measuring temperature, voltage,
and current, vital metrics are fed to the microcontroller. This, in turn,
generates a precise Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal, fine-tuning the
voltage regulation of the buck-boost converter Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field
Effect Transistor (MOSFET) for optimal operation. The adopted approach
emphasizes monitoring environmental metrics, overseeing power outputs, and
generating PWM signals to adeptly manage the buck-boost converter MOSFET
voltage. Concurrently, data is transmitted hourly to a cloud platform,
facilitating real-time monitoring capabilities showcasing the IoT application.
As a result of these integrations, an efficiency improvement of approximately
37.28% was observed. In essence, this research underscores the profound impact
of merging advanced technologies within the renewable energy sector, offering a
robust blueprint for enhancing energy stability and productivity.

Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. The conventional monostatic backscatter
radio is constrained by its limited communication range, which restricts its
utility in wide-area applications. An alternative bi-static backscatter radio
architecture, characterized by a dis-aggregated illuminator and receiver, can
provide enhanced coverage and, thus, can support wide-area applications. In
this paper, we analyze the scalability of the bi-static backscatter radio for
large-scale wide-area IoT networks consisting of a large number of
unsynchronized, receiver-less tags. We introduce the Tag Drop Rate (TDR) as a
measure of reliability and develop a theoretical framework to estimate TDR in
terms of the network parameters. We show that under certain approximations, a
small-scale prototype can emulate a large-scale network. We then use the
measurements from experimental prototypes of bi-static backscatter networks
(BNs) to refine the theoretical model. Finally, based on the insights derived
from the theoretical model and the experimental measurements, we describe a
systematic methodology for tuning the network parameters and identifying the
physical layer design requirements for the reliable operation of large-scale
bi-static BNs. Our analysis shows that even with a modest physical layer
requirement of bit error rate (BER) 0.2, 1000 receiver-less tags can be
supported with 99.9% reliability. This demonstrates the feasibility of
bi-static BNs for large-scale wide-area IoT applications.

                                        <span>  A distributed sensor fusion architecture is preferred in a real
target-tracking scenario as compared to a centralized scheme since it provides
many practical advantages in terms of computation load, communication
bandwidth, fault-tolerance, and scalability. In multi-sensor target-tracking
literature, such systems are better known by the pseudonym - track fusion,
since processed tracks are fused instead of raw measurements. A fundamental
problem, however, in such systems is the presence of unknown correlations
between the tracks, which renders a standard Kalman filter (naive fusion)
useless.
  A widely accepted solution is covariance intersection (CI) which provides
near-optimal estimates but at the cost of a conservative covariance. Thus, the
estimates are pessimistic, which might result in a delayed error convergence.
Also, fusion of Gaussian mixture densities is an active area of research where
standard methods of track fusion cannot be used. In this article, harmonic mean
density (HMD) based fusion is discussed, which seems to handle both of these
issues. We present insights on HMD fusion and prove that the method is a result
of minimizing average Pearson divergence. This article also provides an
alternative and easy implementation based on an importance-sampling-like method
without the requirement of a proposal density. Similarity of HMD with inverse
covariance intersection is an interesting find, and has been discussed in
detail.
  Results based on a real-world multi-target multi-sensor scenario show that
the proposed approach converges quickly than existing track fusion algorithms
while also being consistent, as evident from the normalized estimation-error
squared (NEES) plots.

                                        <span>  In a distributed sensor fusion architecture, using standard Kalman filter
(naive fusion) can lead to degraded results as track correlations are ignored
and conservative fusion strategies are employed as a sub-optimal alternative to
the problem. Since, Gaussian mixtures provide a flexible means of modeling any
density, therefore fusion strategies suitable for use with Gaussian mixtures
are needed. While the generalized covariance intersection (CI) provides a means
to fuse Gaussian mixtures, the procedure is cumbersome and requires evaluating
a non-integer power of the mixture density. In this paper, we develop a
pooling-based fusion strategy using the harmonic mean density (HMD)
interpolation of local densities and show that the proposed method can handle
both Gaussian and mixture densities without much changes to the framework.
Mathematical properties of the proposed fusion strategy are studied and
simulated on 2D and 3D maneuvering target tracking scenarios. The simulations
suggest that the proposed HMD fusion performs better than other conservative
strategies in terms of root-mean-squared error while being consistent.

of disturbance preview information where $p$ is finite. We first derive the
solution for this problem on a finite horizon with linear, time-varying
dynamics and time-varying costs. Next, we derive the solution on the infinite
horizon with linear, time-invariant dynamics and time-invariant costs. Our
proofs rely on the well-known principle of optimality. We provide an
independent proof for the principle of optimality that relies only on nested
information structure. Finally, we show that the finite preview controller
converges to the optimal noncausal controller as the preview horizon $p$ tends
to infinity. We also provide a simple example to illustrate both the finite and
infinite horizon results.

backscatter communication non-orthogonal multiple access (AmBC-NOMA) networks
where non-colluding eavesdroppers (Eves) are randomly distributed. In the
proposed system, a base station (BS) transmits a superimposed signal to a
typical NOMA user pair, while a backscatter device~(BD) simultaneously
transmits its unique signal by reflecting and modulating the BS's signal.
Meanwhile, Eves passively attempt to wiretap the ongoing transmissions.
Notably, the number and locations of Eves are unknown, posing a substantial
security threat to the system. To address this challenge, the BS injects
artificial noise (AN) to mislead the Eves, and a protected zone is employed to
create an Eve-exclusion area around the BS. Theoretical expressions for outage
probability (OP) and intercept probability (IP) are provided to evaluate the
system's reliability-security trade-off. Asymptotic behavior at high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is further explored, including the derivation of
diversity orders for the OP. Numerical results validate the analytical findings
through extensive simulations, demonstrating that both the AN injection and
protected zone can effectively enhance PLS. Furthermore, analysis and insights
of different key parameters, including transmit SNR, reflection efficiency at
the BD, power allocation coefficient, power fraction allocated to desired
signal, Eve-exclusion area radius, Eve distribution density, and backscattered
AN cancellation efficiency, on OP and IP are also provided.

associated with complex nonlinear uncertain systems, this paper investigates
the design of a membership-function-dependent (MFD) memory output-feedback
(MOF) controller for interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy systems under fading channels,
leveraging a memory dynamic event-triggering mechanism (MDETM). To conserve
communication resources, MDETM reduces the frequency of data transmission. For
mitigating design conservatism, a MOF controller is employed. A stochastic
process models the fading channel, accounting for phenomena such as reflection,
refraction, and diffraction that occur during data packet transmission through
networks. An actuator failure model addresses potential faults and inaccuracies
in practical applications. Considering the impacts of channel fading and
actuator failures, the non-parallel distributed compensation (non-PDC) strategy
enhances the robustness and anti-interference capability of the MDETM MOF
controller. By fully exploiting membership function information, novel MFD
control design results ensure mean-square exponential stability and $\mathscr
H_{\infty}$ performance $\gamma$ for the closed-loop system. Simulation studies
validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

                                        <span>  When intelligent spacecraft or space robots perform tasks in a complex
environment, the controllable variables are usually not directly available and
have to be inferred from high-dimensional observable variables, such as outputs
of neural networks or images. While the dynamics of these observations are
highly complex, the mechanisms behind them may be simple, which makes it
possible to regard them as latent dynamic systems. For control of latent
dynamic systems, methods based on reinforcement learning suffer from sample
inefficiency and generalization problems. In this work, we propose an
asymptotic tracking controller for latent dynamic systems. The latent variables
are related to the high-dimensional observations through an unknown nonlinear
function. The dynamics are unknown but assumed to be affine nonlinear. To
realize asymptotic tracking, an identifiable latent dynamic model is learned to
recover the latents and estimate the dynamics. This training process does not
depend on the goals or reference trajectories. Based on the learned model, we
use a manually designed feedback linearization controller to ensure the
asymptotic tracking property of the closed-loop system. After considering fully
controllable systems, the results are extended to the case that uncontrollable
environmental latents exist. As an application, simulation experiments on a
latent spacecraft attitude dynamic model are conducted to verify the proposed
methods, and the observation noise and control deviation are taken into
consideration.

                                        <span>  This paper presents a robust control strategy for output tracking of a
nonlinear 3D PDE-ODE system. The output feedback control was developed by
bounding the solution and its time derivative for both the infinite-dimensional
system and the nonlinear ODE, and leveraging these bounds to ensure the
boundedness of the control coefficient and error dynamics perturbations. The
mathematical framework demonstrates the controller's ability to manage two
output types within the system, overcoming model uncertainties and
heterogeneities using minimal system information and a continuous control
signal. A case study addressing induced seismicity mitigation while ensuring
energy production in the Groningen gas reservoir highlights the control's
effectiveness. The strategy guarantees precise tracking of target seismicity
rates and pressures across reservoir regions, even under parameter
uncertainties. Numerical simulations validate the approach in two scenarios:
gas extraction with minimal seismicity and the addition of CO$_2$ injections
achieving net-zero environmental impact.

issues such as bulky and complex structures, slow response times, and low
safety levels. Consequently, researchers have explored combining various
sensing technologies with optical fibers to develop optical current
transformers that could become the primary choice for power systems in the
future. With the maturation of optoelectronic technology, optical current
transformers have emerged. They offer outstanding advantages, including high
sensitivity, integration, stability, and the ability to operate in complex
environments. This review categorizes optical current transformers based on
different principles, including all-fiber current transformers, those based on
magnetostrictive effects, magneto-optic effects, and thermal effects. It also
discusses their principles, structures, manufacturing techniques, and signal
processing, while forecasting their future development trends.

                                        <span>  Distributed phased Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (phased-MIMO) radar systems
have attracted wide attention in target detection and tracking. However, the
phase-shifting circuits in phased subarrays contribute to high power
consumption and hardware cost. To address this issue, an energy-efficient and
cost-efficient metamaterial antenna array, i.e., reconfigurable holographic
surface (RHS), has been developed. In this letter, we propose RHS-aided
distributed MIMO radar systems to achieve more accurate multi-target detection
under equivalent power consumption and hardware cost as that of distributed
phased-MIMO radar systems. Different from phased arrays, the RHS achieves beam
steering by regulating the radiation amplitude of its elements, and thus
conventional beamforming schemes designed for phased arrays are no longer
applicable. Aiming to maximize detection accuracy, we design an
amplitude-controlled beamforming scheme for multiple RHS transceiver subarrays.
The simulations validate the superiority of the proposed scheme over the
distributed phased-MIMO radar scheme and reveal the optimal allocation of
spatial diversity and coherent processing gain that leads to the best system
performance when hardware resources are fixed.

interest for their expressivity, but solutions rely on linear approximations.
We approach the problem of driving the state of a dynamical system in
distribution from a sequential decision-making perspective. We formulate the
optimal control problem as an appropriate Markov decision process (MDP), where
the actions correspond to the state-feedback control policies. We then solve
the MDP using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). This renders our method suitable
for any dynamics model. A key component of our approach is a novel, easy to
compute, distance metric in the distribution space that allows our algorithm to
guide the distribution of the state. We experimentally test our algorithm under
both linear and nonlinear dynamics.

                                        <span>  Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become standard tools in
reconnaissance and surveying for both civilian and defense applications. In the
future, UAVs will likely play a pivotal role in autonomous package delivery,
but current multi-rotor candidates suffer from poor energy efficiency leading
to insufficient endurance and range. In order to reduce the power demands of
package delivery UAVs while still maintaining necessary hovering capabilities,
companies like Amazon are experimenting with hybrid Vertical Take-Off and
Landing (VTOL) platforms. Tailsitter VTOLs offer a mechanically simple and
cost-effective solution compared to other hybrid VTOL configurations, and while
advances in hardware and microelectronics have optimized the tailsitter for
package delivery, the software behind its operation has largely remained a
critical barrier to industry adoption. Tailsitters currently lack a generic,
computationally efficient method of control that can provide strong safety and
robustness guarantees over the entire flight domain. Further, tailsitters lack
a closed-form method of designing dynamically feasible transition maneuvers
between hover and cruise. In this paper, we survey the modeling and control
methods currently implemented on small-scale tailsitter UAVs, and attempt to
leverage a nonlinear dynamic model to design physically realizable,
continuous-pitch transition maneuvers at constant altitude. Primary results
from this paper isolate potential barriers to constant-altitude transition, and
a novel approach to bypassing these barriers is proposed. While initial results
are unsuccessful at providing feasible transition, this work acts as a stepping
stone for future efforts to design new transition maneuvers that are safe,
robust, and computationally efficient.

generalized equations arising from Nash equilibrium (NE) and generalized NE
(GNE) problems. This ISS property allows the use of inexact computation in
equilibrium-seeking to enable fast solution tracking in dynamic systems and
plays a critical role in the analysis of interconnected plant-optimizer
feedback systems such as model predictive control (MPC) with iterative
optimization algorithms. For NE problems, we address the local convergence of
perturbed Newton methods from the variational inequality (VI) stability
analysis and point out that the ISS of the perturbed Josephy-Newton can be
established under less restrictive stability/regularity conditions compared to
the existing results established for nonlinear optimizations. Agent-distributed
Josephy-Newton methods are then developed to enable agent-wise local
computations. For GNE problems, since they cannot be reduced to VI problems in
general, we use semismooth Newton methods to solve the semismooth equations
arising from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) systems of the GNE problem and show
that the ISS of the perturbed semismooth Newton methods can be established
under a quasi-regularity condition. Agent-distributed updates are also
developed for the GNE-seeking. To illustrate the use of the ISS in dynamic
systems, applications to constrained game-theoretic MPC (CG-MPC) are studied. A
real-time CG-MPC solver with both time- and agent- distributed computations is
developed and is proven to have bounded solution tracking errors.

and VQLS algorithms, to solve optimal power flow problem in electrical grids.
We investigate the effectiveness of these quantum algorithms in comparison to
classical methods. The simulation results presented here which substantially
improve the results in [1] indicate that quantum approaches yield similar
solutions and optimal costs compared to classical methods, suggesting the
potential use case of quantum computing for power system optimization.

(DRL) from real-world applications is how to explore the environment and
collect informative transitions efficiently. The present paper describes
bounded exploration, a novel exploration method that integrates both 'soft' and
intrinsic motivation exploration. Bounded exploration notably improved the Soft
Actor-Critic algorithm's performance and its model-based extension's converging
speed. It achieved the highest score in 6 out of 8 experiments. Bounded
exploration presents an alternative method to introduce intrinsic motivations
to exploration when the original reward function has strict meanings.

                                        <span>  The electricity sector is undergoing substantial transformations due to the
rising electrification of demand, enhanced integration of renewable energy
resources, and the emergence of new technologies. These changes are rendering
the electric grid more volatile and unpredictable, making it difficult to
maintain reliable operations. In order to address these issues, advanced time
series prediction models are needed for closing the gap between the forecasted
and actual grid outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a multivariate time
series prediction model that combines traditional state space models with deep
learning methods to simultaneously capture and predict the underlying dynamics
of multiple time series. Additionally, we design a time series processing
module that incorporates high-resolution external forecasts into
sequence-to-sequence prediction models, achieving this with negligible
increases in size and no loss of accuracy. We also release an extended dataset
spanning five years of load, electricity price, ancillary service price, and
renewable generation. To complement this dataset, we provide an open-access
toolbox that includes our proposed model, the dataset itself, and several
state-of-the-art prediction models, thereby creating a unified framework for
benchmarking advanced machine learning approaches. Our findings indicate that
the proposed model outperforms existing models across various prediction tasks,
improving state-of-the-art prediction error by an average of 7% and decreasing
model parameters by 43%.

                                        <span>  This paper addresses the incompatible case of parallel batch scheduling,
where compatible jobs belong to the same family, and jobs from different
families cannot be processed together in the same batch. Existing constraint
programming (CP) models for this problem fail to synchronize the processing of
the jobs within their batch, resulting in batch interruptions. In the context
of the diffusion area in the semiconductor manufacturing process, these
interrupted solutions would disrupt the thermal stability required for a
uniform dopant distribution on the wafers. This paper proposes three new CP
models that directly tackle these interruptions in the formulation, including
two adaptions of existing models and a novel Redundant Synchronized (RS) model.
These existing and novel models are compared on standard test cases,
demonstrating the superiority of the RS model in finding optimal or
near-optimal solutions quickly.

Control (MPC) formulations, known as MPC for tracking, which are characterized
by including an artificial reference as part of the decision variables in the
optimization problem. These formulations have several benefits with respect to
the classical MPC formulations, including guaranteed recursive feasibility
under online reference changes, as well as asymptotic stability and an
increased domain of attraction. This tutorial paper introduces the concept of
using an artificial reference in MPC, presenting the benefits and theoretical
guarantees obtained by its use. We then provide a survey of the main advances
and extensions of the original linear MPC for tracking, including its
non-linear extension. Additionally, we discuss its application to
learning-based MPC, and discuss optimization aspects related to its
implementation.

                                        <span>  In Bayesian optimization, a black-box function is maximized via the use of a
surrogate model. We apply distributed Thompson sampling, using a Gaussian
process as a surrogate model, to approach the multi-agent Bayesian optimization
problem. In our distributed Thompson sampling implementation, each agent
receives sampled points from neighbors, where the communication network is
encoded in a graph; each agent utilizes their own Gaussian process to model the
objective function. We demonstrate theoretical bounds on Bayesian simple regret
and Bayesian average regret, where the bound depends on the structure of the
communication graph. Unlike in batch Bayesian optimization, this bound is
applicable in cases where the communication graph amongst agents is
constrained. When compared to sequential single-agent Thompson sampling, our
bound guarantees faster convergence with respect to time as long as the
communication graph is connected. We confirm the efficacy of our algorithm with
numerical simulations on traditional optimization test functions, illustrating
the significance of graph connectivity on improving regret convergence.

few rigorous approximation and reinforcement learning results. In this paper,
for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with standard Borel spaces, (i) we first
provide a discretization based approximation method for MDPs with continuous
spaces under average cost criteria, and provide error bounds for approximations
when the dynamics are only weakly continuous (for asymptotic convergence of
errors as the grid sizes vanish) or Wasserstein continuous (with a rate in
approximation as the grid sizes vanish) under certain ergodicity assumptions.
In particular, we relax the total variation condition given in prior work to
weak continuity or Wasserstein continuity. (ii) We provide synchronous and
asynchronous (quantized) Q-learning algorithms for continuous spaces via
quantization (where the quantized state is taken to be the actual state in
corresponding Q-learning algorithms presented in the paper), and establish
their convergence. (iii) We finally show that the convergence is to the optimal
Q values of a finite approximate model constructed via quantization, which
implies near optimality of the arrived solution. Our Q-learning convergence
results and their convergence to near optimality are new for continuous spaces,
and the proof method is new even for finite spaces, to our knowledge.

                                        <span>  With technological advances, mobility has been moving from a product (i.e.,
traditional modes and vehicles), to a service (i.e., Mobility as a Service,
MaaS). However, as observed in other fields (e.g. cloud computing resource
management) we argue that mobility will evolve from a service to a resource
(i.e., Mobility as a Resource, MaaR). Further, due to increasing scarcity of
shared mobility spaces across traditional and emerging modes, the transition
must be viewed within the critical need for ethical and equitable solutions for
the traveling public (i.e., research is needed to avoid hyper-market driven
outcomes for society). The evolution of mobility into a resource requires novel
conceptual frameworks, technologies, processes and perspectives of analysis. A
key component of the future MaaR system is the technological capacity to
observe, allocate and manage (in real-time) the smallest envisionable units of
mobility (i.e., atomic units of mobility capacity) while providing prioritized
attention to human movement and ethical metrics related to access, consumption
and impact. To facilitate research into the envisioned future system, this
paper proposes initial frameworks which synthesize and advance methodologies
relating to highly dynamic capacity reservation systems. Future research
requires synthesis across transport network management, demand behavior,
mixed-mode usage, and equitable mobility.

                                        <span>  Opportunistic spectrum access has the potential to increase the efficiency of
spectrum utilization in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). In CRNs, both spectrum
sensing and resource allocation (SSRA) are critical to maximizing system
throughput while minimizing collisions of secondary users with the primary
network. However, many works in dynamic spectrum access do not consider the
impact of imperfect sensing information such as mis-detected channels, which
the additional information available in joint SSRA can help remediate. In this
work, we examine joint SSRA as an optimization which seeks to maximize a CRN's
net communication rate subject to constraints on channel sensing, channel
access, and transmit power. Given the non-trivial nature of the problem, we
leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning to enable a network of secondary
users to dynamically access unoccupied spectrum via only local test statistics,
formulated under the energy detection paradigm of spectrum sensing. In doing
so, we develop a novel multi-agent implementation of hybrid soft actor critic,
MHSAC, based on the QMIX mixing scheme. Through experiments, we find that our
SSRA algorithm, HySSRA, is successful in maximizing the CRN's utilization of
spectrum resources while also limiting its interference with the primary
network, and outperforms the current state-of-the-art by a wide margin. We also
explore the impact of wireless variations such as coherence time on the
efficacy of the system.

                                        <span>  In this article, we discuss two algorithms tailored to discrete-time
deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called
deterministic trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms can be derived
from an emerging theoretical paradigm that we refer to as probabilistic optimal
control. The paradigm reformulates stochastic optimal control as an equivalent
probabilistic inference problem and can be viewed as a generalisation of the
former. The merit of this perspective is that it allows to address the problem
using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. It is shown that the application
of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies
that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy
evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification
methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally
closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related
methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The
main advantage of the algorithms is an improved balance between exploration and
exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and
accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different
nonlinear systems.

utilized i) to select a suitable state estimation algorithm by assessing the
nonlinearity of a system model, ii) to adapt the estimation algorithm structure
or parameters, or iii) to indicate the possible effect of strong nonlinearity
that leads to estimate credibility loss. This paper summarizes the state of the
art of nonlinearity measures, focusing on the mean-square-error-based measure
of nonlinearity. Its weak point related to unit selection is illustrated, and
based on this, requirements for a new measure of nonlinearity are formulated. A
new nonlinearity measure that is both unitless and normalized is designed. Its
properties are demonstrated using numerical tracking experiments.

                                        <span>  Fluid antenna systems (FASs) can reconfigure their antenna locations freely
within a spatially continuous space. To keep favorable antenna positions, the
channel state information (CSI) acquisition for FASs is essential. While some
techniques have been proposed, most existing FAS channel estimators require
several channel assumptions, such as slow variation and angular-domain
sparsity. When these assumptions are not reasonable, the model mismatch may
lead to unpredictable performance losses. In this paper, we propose the
successive Bayesian reconstructor (S-BAR) as a general solution to estimate FAS
channels. Unlike model-based estimators, the proposed S-BAR is prior-aided,
which builds the experiential kernel for CSI acquisition. Inspired by Bayesian
regression, the key idea of S-BAR is to model the FAS channels as a stochastic
process, whose uncertainty can be successively eliminated by kernel-based
sampling and regression. In this way, the predictive mean of the regressed
stochastic process can be viewed as a Bayesian channel estimator. Simulation
results verify that, in both model-mismatched and model-matched cases, the
proposed S-BAR can achieve higher estimation accuracy than the existing
schemes.

                                        <span>  The rapid proliferation of Internet-of-things (IoT) as well as mobile devices
such as Electric Vehicles (EVs), has led to unpredictable load at the grid. The
demand to supply ratio is particularly exacerbated at a few grid aggregators
(charging stations) with excessive demand due to the geographic location, peak
time, etc. Existing solutions on demand response cannot achieve significant
improvements based only on time-shifting the loads without considering the
device properties such as charging modes and movement capabilities to enable
geographic migration. Additionally, the information on the spare capacity at a
few aggregators can aid in re-channeling the load from other aggregators facing
excess demand to allow migration of devices. In this paper, we model these
flexible properties of the devices as a mixed-integer non-linear problem
(MINLP) to minimize excess load and the improve the utility (benefit) across
all devices. We propose an online distributed low-complexity heuristic that
prioritizes devices based on demand and deadlines to minimize the cumulative
loss in utility. The proposed heuristic is tested on an exhaustive set of
synthetic data and compared with solutions from a solver/optimization tool for
the same runtime to show the impracticality of using a solver. A real-world EV
testbed data is also tested with our proposed solution and other scheduling
solutions to show the practicality of generating a feasible schedule and a loss
improvement of at least 57.23%.

                                        <span>  This paper introduces the reinforcement learning backup shield (RLBUS), an
algorithm that guarantees safe exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) by
incorporating backup control barrier functions (BCBFs). RLBUS constructs an
implicit control forward invariant subset of the safe set using multiple backup
policies, ensuring safety in the presence of input constraints. While
traditional BCBFs often result in conservative control forward-invariant sets
due to the design of backup controllers, RLBUS addresses this limitation by
leveraging model-free RL to train an additional backup policy, which enlarges
the identified control forward invariant subset of the safe set. This approach
enables the exploration of larger regions in the state space with zero safety
violations during training. The effectiveness of RLBUS is demonstrated on an
inverted pendulum example, where the expanded invariant set allows for safe
exploration over a broader state space, enhancing performance without
compromising safety.

                                        <span>  We study the problem of solving matrix games of the form
$\max_{\mathbf{w}\in\mathcal{W}}\min_{\mathbf{p}\in\Delta}\mathbf{p}^{\top}A\mathbf{w}$,
where $A$ is some matrix and $\Delta$ is the probability simplex. This problem
encapsulates canonical tasks such as finding a linear separator and computing
Nash equilibria in zero-sum games. However, perhaps surprisingly, its inherent
complexity (as formalized in the standard framework of oracle complexity
[Nemirovski and Yudin, 1983]) is not well-understood. In this work, we first
identify different oracle models which are implicitly used by prior algorithms,
amounting to multiplying the matrix $A$ by a vector from either one or both
sides. We then prove complexity lower bounds for algorithms under both access
models, which in particular imply a separation between them. Specifically, we
start by proving that algorithms for linear separability based on one-sided
multiplications must require $\Omega(\gamma_A^{-2})$ iterations, where
$\gamma_A$ is the margin, as matched by the Perceptron algorithm. We then prove
that accelerated algorithms for this task, which utilize multiplications from
both sides, must require $\tilde{\Omega}(\gamma_{A}^{-2/3})$ iterations,
establishing the first oracle complexity barrier for such algorithms. Finally,
by adapting our lower bound to $\ell_1$ geometry, we prove that computing an
$\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium requires
$\tilde{\Omega}(\epsilon^{-2/5})$ iterations, which is an exponential
improvement over the previously best-known lower bound due to Hadiji et al.

present regularity and continuity conditions for POMDPs and their belief-MDP
reductions, where these constitute weak Feller and Wasserstein regularity and
controlled filter stability. These are then utilized to arrive at existence
results on optimal policies for both discounted and average cost problems, and
regularity of value functions. Then, we study rigorous approximation results
involving quantization based finite model approximations as well as finite
window approximations under controlled filter stability. Finally, we present
several recent reinforcement learning theoretic results which rigorously
establish convergence to near optimality under both criteria.

                                        <span>  The study of unconstrained convex optimization has historically been
concerned with worst-case a priori convergence rates. The development of the
Optimized Gradient Method (OGM), due to Drori and Teboulle, Kim and Fessler,
marked a major milestone in this study, as OGM achieves the optimal worst-case
convergence rate among all gradient-span first-order methods. However, this
notion of worst-case optimality is relatively coarse and allows OGM to have
worst-case performance even on instances where stronger convergence guarantees
are possible. For example, OGM is known to converge at its worst-case rate even
on the toy example $Lx^2/2$, where exact convergence in just two steps is
possible.
  We introduce a notion of optimality which is stronger than minimax optimality
that requires a method to give optimal dynamic guarantees that exploit any
"non-adversarialness" in the first-order oracle's reported information. We then
give an algorithm which achieves this stronger optimality notion: the Subgame
Perfect Gradient Method (SPGM). SPGM is a refinement of OGM whose update rules
and convergence guarantees are dynamically computed in response to first-order
information seen during the algorithm's execution. From a game-theoretic
viewpoint, OGM can be seen as one side of a Nash Equilibrium for the
"minimization game" whereas SPGM can be seen as one side of a Subgame Perfect
Equilibrium for the same game. We also show that SPGM can be implemented with
minimal computational and storage overhead in each iteration and provide a
Julia implementation.

                                        <span>  This paper considers the discrete-time, stochastic LQR problem with $p$ steps
of disturbance preview information where $p$ is finite. We first derive the
solution for this problem on a finite horizon with linear, time-varying
dynamics and time-varying costs. Next, we derive the solution on the infinite
horizon with linear, time-invariant dynamics and time-invariant costs. Our
proofs rely on the well-known principle of optimality. We provide an
independent proof for the principle of optimality that relies only on nested
information structure. Finally, we show that the finite preview controller
converges to the optimal noncausal controller as the preview horizon $p$ tends
to infinity. We also provide a simple example to illustrate both the finite and
infinite horizon results.

                                        <span>  This paper introduces Data-enabled Predictive Control Hyperparameter Tuning
via Differentiable Optimization (DeePC-Hunt), a backpropagation-based method
for automatic hyperparameter tuning of the DeePC algorithm. The necessity for
such a method arises from the importance of hyperparameter selection to achieve
satisfactory closed-loop DeePC performance. The standard methods for
hyperparameter selection are to either optimize the open-loop performance, or
use manual guess-and-check. Optimizing the open-loop performance can result in
unacceptable closed-loop behavior, while manual guess-and-check can pose safety
challenges. DeePC-Hunt provides an alternative method for hyperparameter tuning
which uses an approximate model of the system dynamics and backpropagation to
directly optimize hyperparameters for the closed-loop DeePC performance.
Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of DeePC in combination
with DeePC-Hunt in a complex stabilization task for a nonlinear system and its
superiority over model-based control strategies in terms of robustness to model
misspecifications.

of missing data on the Dirichlet boundary condition is considered. It is
formulated by optimizing the deformation field that varies the spatial domain
where the Poisson equation is posed. To take into consideration the missing
boundary data the problem is formulated as a no-regret problem and approximated
by low-regret problems. This approach allows to obtain deformation fields which
are robust against the missing information. The formulation of the regret
problems was achieved by employing the Fenchel transform. Convergence of the
solutions of the low-regret to the no-regret problems is analysed, the gradient
of the cost is characterized and a first order numerical method is proposed.
Numerical examples illustrate the robustness of the low-regret deformation
fields with respect to missing data. This is likely the first time that a
numerical investigation is reported on for the level of effectiveness of the
low-regret approach in the presence of missing data in an optimal control
problem.

                                        <span>  We consider a bilevel learning framework for learning linear operators. In
this framework, the learnable parameters are optimized via a loss function that
also depends on the minimizer of a convex optimization problem (denoted
lower-level problem). We utilize an iterative algorithm called `piggyback' to
compute the gradient of the loss and minimizer of the lower-level problem.
Given that the lower-level problem is solved numerically, the loss function and
thus its gradient can only be computed inexactly. To estimate the accuracy of
the computed hypergradient, we derive an a-posteriori error bound, which
provides guides for setting the tolerance for the lower-level problem, as well
as the piggyback algorithm. To efficiently solve the upper-level optimization,
we also propose an adaptive method for choosing a suitable step-size. To
illustrate the proposed method, we consider a few learned regularizer problems,
such as training an input-convex neural network.

collision avoidance considering uncertainty and an unknown model from a
payload. To address this challenge, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics
(SINDy) is used to obtain the governing equation of the multirotor system. The
SINDy can discover the equations of target systems with low data, assuming that
few functions have the dominant characteristic of the system. Model predictive
control (MPC) is utilized to obtain accurate trajectory tracking performance by
considering state and control input constraints. To avoid a collision during
operation, MPC optimization problem is again formulated using inequality
constraints about an obstacle. In simulation, SINDy can discover a governing
equation of multirotor system including mass parameter uncertainty and
aerodynamic effects. In addition, the simulation results show that the proposed
method has the capability to avoid an obstacle and track the desired trajectory
accurately.

                                        <span>  This paper presents a robust control strategy for output tracking of a
nonlinear 3D PDE-ODE system. The output feedback control was developed by
bounding the solution and its time derivative for both the infinite-dimensional
system and the nonlinear ODE, and leveraging these bounds to ensure the
boundedness of the control coefficient and error dynamics perturbations. The
mathematical framework demonstrates the controller's ability to manage two
output types within the system, overcoming model uncertainties and
heterogeneities using minimal system information and a continuous control
signal. A case study addressing induced seismicity mitigation while ensuring
energy production in the Groningen gas reservoir highlights the control's
effectiveness. The strategy guarantees precise tracking of target seismicity
rates and pressures across reservoir regions, even under parameter
uncertainties. Numerical simulations validate the approach in two scenarios:
gas extraction with minimal seismicity and the addition of CO$_2$ injections
achieving net-zero environmental impact.

                                        <span>  This paper presents new first-order methods for achieving optimal oracle
complexities in convex optimization with convex functional constraints. Oracle
complexities are measured by the number of function and gradient evaluations.
To achieve this, we enable first-order methods to utilize computational oracles
for solving diagonal quadratic programs in subproblems. For problems where the
optimal value $f^*$ is known, such as those in overparameterized models and
feasibility problems, we propose an accelerated first-order method that
incorporates a modified Polyak step size and Nesterov's momentum. Notably, our
method does not require knowledge of smoothness levels, H\"{o}lder continuity
parameter of the gradient, or additional line search, yet achieves the optimal
oracle complexity bound of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2/(1+3\rho)})$ under
H\"{o}lder smoothness conditions. When $f^*$ is unknown, we reformulate the
problem as finding the root of the optimal value function and develop inexact
fixed-point iteration and secant method to compute $f^*$. These root-finding
subproblems are solved inexactly using first-order methods to a specified
relative accuracy. We employ the accelerated prox-level (APL) method, which is
proven to be uniformly optimal for convex optimization with simple constraints.
Our analysis demonstrates that APL-based level-set methods also achieve the
optimal oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2/(1+3\rho)})$ for
convex function-constrained optimization, without requiring knowledge of any
problem-specific structures. Through experiments on various tasks, we
demonstrate the advantages of our methods over existing approaches in
function-constrained optimization.

                                        <span>  This paper addresses the incompatible case of parallel batch scheduling,
where compatible jobs belong to the same family, and jobs from different
families cannot be processed together in the same batch. Existing constraint
programming (CP) models for this problem fail to synchronize the processing of
the jobs within their batch, resulting in batch interruptions. In the context
of the diffusion area in the semiconductor manufacturing process, these
interrupted solutions would disrupt the thermal stability required for a
uniform dopant distribution on the wafers. This paper proposes three new CP
models that directly tackle these interruptions in the formulation, including
two adaptions of existing models and a novel Redundant Synchronized (RS) model.
These existing and novel models are compared on standard test cases,
demonstrating the superiority of the RS model in finding optimal or
near-optimal solutions quickly.

equivalently formulated, the problem of computing a set obtained by applying a
linear mapping to a convex feasible set. This includes the problem of
approximating convex sets by polyhedrons. The existing literature on convex
projections provides methods for bounded convex sets only, in this paper we
propose a method that can handle both bounded and unbounded problems. The
algorithms we propose build on the ideas of inner and outer approximation. In
particular, we adapt the recently proposed methods for solving unbounded convex
vector optimization problems to handle also the class of projection problems.

                                        <span>  Resided at the intersection of multi-fidelity optimization (MFO) and Bayesian
optimization (BO), MF BO has found a niche in solving expensive engineering
design optimization problems, thanks to its advantages in incorporating
physical and mathematical understandings of the problems, saving resources,
addressing exploitation-exploration trade-off, considering uncertainty, and
processing parallel computing. The increasing number of works dedicated to MF
BO suggests the need for a comprehensive review of this advanced optimization
technique. In this paper, we survey recent developments of two essential
ingredients of MF BO: Gaussian process (GP) based MF surrogates and acquisition
functions. We first categorize the existing MF modeling methods and MFO
strategies to locate MF BO in a large family of surrogate-based optimization
and MFO algorithms. We then exploit the common properties shared between the
methods from each ingredient of MF BO to describe important GP-based MF
surrogate models and review various acquisition functions. By doing so, we
expect to provide a structured understanding of MF BO. Finally, we attempt to
reveal important aspects that require further research for applications of MF
BO in solving intricate yet important design optimization problems, including
constrained optimization, high-dimensional optimization, optimization under
uncertainty, and multi-objective optimization.

                                        <span>  Bayesian optimization devolves the global optimization of a costly objective
function to the global optimization of a sequence of acquisition functions.
This inner-loop optimization can be catastrophically difficult if it involves
posterior sample paths, especially in higher dimensions. We introduce an
efficient global optimization strategy for posterior samples based on global
rootfinding. It provides gradient-based optimizers with two sets of judiciously
selected starting points, designed to combine exploration and exploitation. The
number of starting points can be kept small without sacrificing optimization
quality. Remarkably, even with just one point from each set, the global optimum
is discovered most of the time. The algorithm scales practically linearly to
high dimensions, breaking the curse of dimensionality. For Gaussian process
Thompson sampling (GP-TS), we demonstrate remarkable improvement in both inner-
and outer-loop optimization, surprisingly outperforming alternatives like EI
and GP-UCB in most cases. Our approach also improves the performance of other
posterior sample-based acquisition functions, such as variants of entropy
search. Furthermore, we propose a sample-average formulation of GP-TS, which
has a parameter to explicitly control exploitation and can be computed at the
cost of one posterior sample. Our implementation is available at
https://github.com/UQUH/TSRoots .

                                        <span>  Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find an optimal policy for Markov
decision processes (MDPs) using a pre-collected dataset. In this work, we
revisit the linear programming (LP) reformulation of Markov decision processes
for offline RL, with the goal of developing algorithms with optimal
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$ sample complexity, where $n$ is the sample size, under partial
data coverage and general function approximation, and with favorable
computational tractability. To this end, we derive new \emph{error bounds} for
both the dual and primal-dual formulations of the LP, and incorporate them
properly as \emph{constraints} in the LP reformulation. We then show that under
a completeness-type assumption, $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ sample complexity can be
achieved under standard single-policy coverage assumption, when one properly
\emph{relaxes} the occupancy validity constraint in the LP. This framework can
readily handle both infinite-horizon discounted and average-reward MDPs, in
both general function approximation and tabular cases. The instantiation to the
tabular case achieves either state-of-the-art or the first sample complexities
of offline RL in these settings. To further remove any completeness-type
assumption, we then introduce a proper \emph{lower-bound constraint} in the LP,
and a variant of the standard single-policy coverage assumption. Such an
algorithm leads to a $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ sample complexity with dependence on the
\emph{value-function gap}, with only realizability assumptions. Our properly
constrained LP framework advances the existing results in several aspects, in
relaxing certain assumptions and achieving the optimal $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ sample
complexity, with simple analyses. We hope our results bring new insights into
the use of LP formulations and the equivalent primal-dual minimax optimization
for offline RL, through the error-bound induced constraints.

Beltr\'{a}n and Pardo proved the existence of an efficient randomized algorithm
and Lairez recently showed it can be de-randomized to produce a deterministic
efficient algorithm. Here we consider the real setting, to which previously
developed methods do not apply. We describe a polynomial time algorithm that
finds solutions (with high probability) for $n= d -O(\sqrt{d\log d})$ if the
maximal degree is bounded by $d^2$ and for $n=d-1$ if the maximal degree is
larger than $d^2$.

                                        <span>  In federated learning (FL), accommodating clients' varied computational
capacities poses a challenge, often limiting the participation of those with
constrained resources in global model training. To address this issue, the
concept of model heterogeneity through submodel extraction has emerged,
offering a tailored solution that aligns the model's complexity with each
client's computational capacity. In this work, we propose Federated
Importance-Aware Submodel Extraction (FIARSE), a novel approach that
dynamically adjusts submodels based on the importance of model parameters,
thereby overcoming the limitations of previous static and dynamic submodel
extraction methods. Compared to existing works, the proposed method offers a
theoretical foundation for the submodel extraction and eliminates the need for
additional information beyond the model parameters themselves to determine
parameter importance, significantly reducing the overhead on clients. Extensive
experiments are conducted on various datasets to showcase the superior
performance of the proposed FIARSE.

                                        <span>  In Bayesian optimization, a black-box function is maximized via the use of a
surrogate model. We apply distributed Thompson sampling, using a Gaussian
process as a surrogate model, to approach the multi-agent Bayesian optimization
problem. In our distributed Thompson sampling implementation, each agent
receives sampled points from neighbors, where the communication network is
encoded in a graph; each agent utilizes their own Gaussian process to model the
objective function. We demonstrate theoretical bounds on Bayesian simple regret
and Bayesian average regret, where the bound depends on the structure of the
communication graph. Unlike in batch Bayesian optimization, this bound is
applicable in cases where the communication graph amongst agents is
constrained. When compared to sequential single-agent Thompson sampling, our
bound guarantees faster convergence with respect to time as long as the
communication graph is connected. We confirm the efficacy of our algorithm with
numerical simulations on traditional optimization test functions, illustrating
the significance of graph connectivity on improving regret convergence.

for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with standard Borel spaces, (i) we first
provide a discretization based approximation method for MDPs with continuous
spaces under average cost criteria, and provide error bounds for approximations
when the dynamics are only weakly continuous (for asymptotic convergence of
errors as the grid sizes vanish) or Wasserstein continuous (with a rate in
approximation as the grid sizes vanish) under certain ergodicity assumptions.
In particular, we relax the total variation condition given in prior work to
weak continuity or Wasserstein continuity. (ii) We provide synchronous and
asynchronous (quantized) Q-learning algorithms for continuous spaces via
quantization (where the quantized state is taken to be the actual state in
corresponding Q-learning algorithms presented in the paper), and establish
their convergence. (iii) We finally show that the convergence is to the optimal
Q values of a finite approximate model constructed via quantization, which
implies near optimality of the arrived solution. Our Q-learning convergence
results and their convergence to near optimality are new for continuous spaces,
and the proof method is new even for finite spaces, to our knowledge.

the development of essential lemmas that provide a rigorous foundation for
analyzing the well-posedness of these equations. In addition, we extend our
analysis to singular mean-field forward stochastic Volterra integral equations
(MF-FSVIEs) in infinite-dimensional spaces, demonstrating their solvability and
unique adapted solutions. Finally, we strengthen our theoretical results by
applying them to derive stochastic maximum principles, showcasing the practical

body of research on mean-field stochastic equations and their applications in
control theory and mathematical finance.

models, in scenarios in which the infected population is constrained to be
lower than a critical threshold imposed by the ICU (intensive care unit)
capacity. The vaccination effort possibly imposed by the health-care deciders
is classically modeled by a control input affecting the epidemic dynamic. After
a preliminary viability analysis the existence of optimal controls is
established, and their structure is characterized by using a state-constrained
version of Pontryagin's theorem. The resulting optimal controls necessarily
have a bang-bang regime with at most one switch. More precisely, the optimal
strategies impose the maximum-allowed vaccination effort in an initial period
of time, which can cease only once the ICU constraint can be satisfied without
further vaccination. The switching times are characterized in order to identify
conditions under which vaccination should be implemented or halted. The
uniqueness of the optimal control is also discussed. Numerical examples
illustrate our theoretical results and the corresponding optimal strategies.
The analysis is eventually extended to the infinite horizon by
$\Gamma$-convergence arguments.

                                        <span>  McCormick envelopes are a standard tool for deriving convex relaxations of
optimization problems that involve polynomial terms. Such McCormick relaxations
provide lower bounds, for example, in branch-and-bound procedures for
mixed-integer nonlinear programs but have not gained much attention in
PDE-constrained optimization so far. This lack of attention may be due to the
distributed nature of such problems, which on the one hand leads to infinitely
many linear constraints (generally state constraints that may be difficult to
handle) in addition to the state equation for a pointwise formulation of the
McCormick envelopes and renders bound-tightening procedures that successively
improve the resulting convex relaxations computationally intractable.
  We analyze McCormick envelopes for a problem class that is governed by a
semilinear PDE involving a bilinearity and integrality constraints. We
approximate the nonlinearity by averaging the involved terms over the cells of
a partition of the computational domain on which the PDE is defined. This
yields convex relaxations that underestimate the original problem up to an a
priori error estimate that depends on the mesh size of the discretization.
These approximate McCormick relaxations can be improved by means of an
optimization-based bound-tightening procedure. We show that their minimizers
converge to minimizers to a limit problem with a pointwise formulation of the
McCormick envelopes when driving the mesh size to zero.
  We provide a computational example, for which we certify all of our imposed
assumptions. The results point to both the potential of the methodology and the
gaps in the research that need to be closed.

                                        <span>  The goal of this article is to contribute to a better understanding of the
relations between the exact controllability of nonlinear PDEs and the control
theory for ODEs based on Lie brackets, through a study of the Schr\"odinger PDE
with bilinear control. We focus on the small-time local controllability (STLC)
around an equilibrium, when the linearized system is not controllable. We study
the second-order term in the Taylor expansion of the state, with respect to the
control. For scalar-input ODEs, quadratic terms never recover controllability:
they induce signed drifts in the dynamics. Thus proving STLC requires to go at
least to the third order. Similar results were proved for the bilinear
Schr\"odinger PDE with scalar-input controls. In this article, we study the
case of multi-input systems. We clarify among the quadratic Lie brackets, those
that allow to recover STLC: they are bilinear with respect to two different
controls. For ODEs, our result is a consequence of Sussman's sufficient
condition $S(\theta)$ (when focused on quadratic terms), but we propose a new
proof, designed to prepare an easier transfer to PDEs. This proof relies on a
representation formula of the state inspired by the Magnus formula. By adapting
it, we prove a new STLC result for the bilinear Schr\"odinger PDE.

                                        <span>  Adaptive methods are extremely popular in machine learning as they make
learning rate tuning less expensive. This paper introduces a novel optimization
algorithm named KATE, which presents a scale-invariant adaptation of the
well-known AdaGrad algorithm. We prove the scale-invariance of KATE for the
case of Generalized Linear Models. Moreover, for general smooth non-convex
problems, we establish a convergence rate of $O \left(\frac{\log T}{\sqrt{T}}
\right)$ for KATE, matching the best-known ones for AdaGrad and Adam. We also
compare KATE to other state-of-the-art adaptive algorithms Adam and AdaGrad in
numerical experiments with different problems, including complex machine
learning tasks like image classification and text classification on real data.
The results indicate that KATE consistently outperforms AdaGrad and
matches/surpasses the performance of Adam in all considered scenarios.

                                        <span>  Adaptive optimizers, such as Adam, have achieved remarkable success in deep
learning. A key component of these optimizers is the so-called preconditioning
matrix, providing enhanced gradient information and regulating the step size of
each gradient direction. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
designing the preconditioning matrix by utilizing the gradient difference
between two successive steps as the diagonal elements. These diagonal elements
are closely related to the Hessian and can be perceived as an approximation of
the inner product between the Hessian row vectors and difference of the
adjacent parameter vectors. Additionally, we introduce an auto-switching
function that enables the preconditioning matrix to switch dynamically between
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and the adaptive optimizer. Based on these
two techniques, we develop a new optimizer named AGD that enhances the
generalization performance. We evaluate AGD on public datasets of Natural
Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), and Recommendation Systems
(RecSys). Our experimental results demonstrate that AGD outperforms the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) optimizers, achieving highly competitive or
significantly better predictive performance. Furthermore, we analyze how AGD is
able to switch automatically between SGD and the adaptive optimizer and its
actual effects on various scenarios. The code is available at

                                        <span>  In this article, we discuss two algorithms tailored to discrete-time
deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called
deterministic trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms can be derived
from an emerging theoretical paradigm that we refer to as probabilistic optimal
control. The paradigm reformulates stochastic optimal control as an equivalent
probabilistic inference problem and can be viewed as a generalisation of the
former. The merit of this perspective is that it allows to address the problem
using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. It is shown that the application
of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies
that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy
evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification
methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally
closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related
methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The
main advantage of the algorithms is an improved balance between exploration and
exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and
accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different
nonlinear systems.

conformable fractional-order derivatives. We begin by establishing the
existence and uniqueness of the evolution operator for a class of
non-autonomous fractional-order homogeneous systems. Using Schauder's
fixed-point theorem and the theory of linear evolution systems, we derive
sufficient conditions for the existence of a mild solution for a class of
non-autonomous conformable fractional semilinear systems. This solution does
not require the Lipschitz condition on the semilinear parts. Additionally, the
paper addresses the exact null controllability of abstract systems. An example
is presented to demonstrate the practical applications of the results.

for fair classification in machine learning. In this framework, the fair
learning process is divided into three stages. Each stage aims to reduce
unfairness, such as disparate impact and disparate mistreatment, in the final
prediction. For the preprocessing stage, we present a resampling method that
addresses unfairness coming from data imbalances. The in-processing phase
consist of a classification method. This can be either one coming from the
MLJ.jl package, or a user defined one. For this phase, we incorporate fair ML
methods that can handle unfairness to a certain degree through their
optimization process. In the post-processing, we discuss the choice of the
cut-off value for fair prediction. With simulations, we show the performance of
the single phases and their combinations.

                                        <span>  When using machine learning for automated prediction, it is important to
account for fairness in the prediction. Fairness in machine learning aims to
ensure that biases in the data and model inaccuracies do not lead to
discriminatory decisions. E.g., predictions from fair machine learning models
should not discriminate against sensitive variables such as sexual orientation
and ethnicity. The training data often in obtained from social surveys. In
social surveys, oftentimes the data collection process is a strata sampling,
e.g. due to cost restrictions. In strata samples, the assumption of
independence between the observation is not fulfilled. Hence, if the machine
learning models do not account for the strata correlations, the results may be
biased. Especially high is the bias in cases where the strata assignment is
correlated to the variable of interest. We present in this paper an algorithm
that can handle both problems simultaneously, and we demonstrate the impact of
stratified sampling on the quality of fair machine learning predictions in a
reproducible simulation study.

                                        <span>  Max-plus algebra is a semiring with addition $a\oplus b = \max(a,b)$ and
multiplication $a\otimes b = a+b$. It is applied in cases, such as
combinatorial optimization and discrete event systems. We consider the power of
max-plus square matrices, which is equivalent to obtaining the all-pair maximum
weight paths with a fixed length in the corresponding weighted digraph. Each
$n$-by-$n$ matrix admits the CSR expansion that decomposes the matrix into a
sum of at most $n$ periodic terms after $O(n^{2})$ times of powers. In this
study, we propose an $O(n(m+n \log n))$ time algorithm for the CSR expansion,
where $m$ is the number of nonzero entries in the matrix, which improves the
$O(n^{4} \log n)$ algorithm known for this problem. Our algorithm is based on
finding the roots of the characteristic polynomial of the max-plus matrix.
These roots play a similar role to the eigenvalues of the matrix, and become
the growth rates of the terms in the CSR expansion.

                                        <span>  The rapid proliferation of Internet-of-things (IoT) as well as mobile devices
such as Electric Vehicles (EVs), has led to unpredictable load at the grid. The
demand to supply ratio is particularly exacerbated at a few grid aggregators
(charging stations) with excessive demand due to the geographic location, peak
time, etc. Existing solutions on demand response cannot achieve significant
improvements based only on time-shifting the loads without considering the
device properties such as charging modes and movement capabilities to enable
geographic migration. Additionally, the information on the spare capacity at a
few aggregators can aid in re-channeling the load from other aggregators facing
excess demand to allow migration of devices. In this paper, we model these
flexible properties of the devices as a mixed-integer non-linear problem
(MINLP) to minimize excess load and the improve the utility (benefit) across
all devices. We propose an online distributed low-complexity heuristic that
prioritizes devices based on demand and deadlines to minimize the cumulative
loss in utility. The proposed heuristic is tested on an exhaustive set of
synthetic data and compared with solutions from a solver/optimization tool for
the same runtime to show the impracticality of using a solver. A real-world EV
testbed data is also tested with our proposed solution and other scheduling
solutions to show the practicality of generating a feasible schedule and a loss
improvement of at least 57.23%.

minimizing a proximable convex function subject to satisfying a set of linear
constraints within a specified tolerance. For this task, we present a proximal
projection (PP) algorithm, which is an instance of Douglas-Rachford splitting
that directly uses projections onto the set of constraints. Formal guarantees
are presented to prove convergence of PP estimates to optimizers. Unlike many
methods that obtain feasibility asymptotically, each PP iterate is feasible.
Numerically, we show PP either matches or outperforms alternatives (e.g.
linearized Bregman, primal dual hybrid gradient, proximal augmented Lagrangian,
proximal gradient) on problems in basis pursuit, stable matrix completion,
stable principal component pursuit, and the computation of earth mover's
distances.

                                        <span>  Autonomous robots operating in real environments are often faced with
decisions on how best to navigate their surroundings. In this work, we address
a particular instance of this problem: how can a robot autonomously decide on
the energetically optimal path to follow given a high-level objective and
information about the surroundings? To tackle this problem we developed a
self-supervised learning method that allows the robot to estimate the cost of
transport of its surroundings using only vision inputs. We apply our method to
the multi-modal mobility morphobot (M4), a robot that can drive, fly, segway,
and crawl through its environment. By deploying our system in the real world,
we show that our method accurately assigns different cost of transports to
various types of environments e.g. grass vs smooth road. We also highlight the
low computational cost of our method, which is deployed on an Nvidia Jetson
Orin Nano robotic compute unit. We believe that this work will allow
multi-modal robotic platforms to unlock their full potential for navigation and
exploration tasks.

                                        <span>  Generalizing metric monocular depth estimation presents a significant
challenge due to its ill-posed nature, while the entanglement between camera
parameters and depth amplifies issues further, hindering multi-dataset training
and zero-shot accuracy. This challenge is particularly evident in autonomous
vehicles and mobile robotics, where data is collected with fixed camera setups,
limiting the geometric diversity. Yet, this context also presents an
opportunity: the fixed relationship between the camera and the ground plane
imposes additional perspective geometry constraints, enabling depth regression
via vertical image positions of objects. However, this cue is highly
susceptible to overfitting, thus we propose a novel canonical representation
that maintains consistency across varied camera setups, effectively
disentangling depth from specific parameters and enhancing generalization
across datasets. We also propose a novel architecture that adaptively and
probabilistically fuses depths estimated via object size and vertical image
position cues. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the
proposed approach on five autonomous driving datasets, achieving accurate
metric depth estimation for varying resolutions, aspect ratios and camera
setups. Notably, we achieve comparable accuracy to existing zero-shot methods,
despite training on a single dataset with a single-camera setup.

minimally invasive surgery (MIS). We develop and adopt a novel
task-priority-based kinematic formulation to quantitatively investigate
teleoperation commands for continuum instruments under remote center of motion
(RCM) constraints. Using redundancy resolution methods, we investigate the
kinematic performance during teleoperation, comparing linear and angular
commands within a task-priority scheme. For experimental validation, an
instrument module (IM) was designed and integrated with a 7-DoF manipulator.
  Assessments, simulations, and experimental validations demonstrated the
effectiveness of the proposed framework. The experiments involved several
tasks: trajectory tracking of the IM tip along multiple paths with varying
priorities for linear and angular teleoperation commands, pushing a ball along
predefined paths on a silicon board, following a pattern on a pegboard, and
guiding the continuum tip through rings on a ring board using a standard
surgical kit.

                                        <span>  Existing LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) frameworks typically utilize prior
state trajectories derived from IMU integration to compensate for the motion
distortion within LiDAR frames, and demonstrate outstanding accuracy and
stability in regular low-speed and smooth scenes. However, in high-speed or
intense motion scenarios, the residual distortion may increase due to the
limitation of IMU's accuracy and frequency, which will degrade the consistency
between the LiDAR frame with its represented geometric environment, leading
pointcloud registration to fall into local optima and consequently increasing
the drift in long-time and large-scale localization.
  To address the issue, we propose a novel asymptotically and consistently
converging LIO framework called AC-LIO. First, during the iterative state
estimation, we backwards propagate the update term based on the prior state
chain, and asymptotically compensate the residual distortion before next
iteration. Second, considering the weak correlation between the initial error
and motion distortion of current frame, we propose a convergence criteria based
on pointcloud constraints to control the back propagation. The approach of
guiding the asymptotic distortion compensation based on convergence criteria
can promote the consistent convergence of pointcloud registration and increase
the accuracy and robustness of LIO. Experiments show that our AC-LIO framework,
compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks, effectively promotes consistent
convergence in state estimation and further improves the accuracy of long-time
and large-scale localization and mapping.

                                        <span>  Realizing scaling laws in embodied AI has become a focus. However, previous
work has been scattered across diverse simulation platforms, with assets and
models lacking unified interfaces, which has led to inefficiencies in research.
To address this, we introduce InfiniteWorld, a unified and scalable simulator
for general vision-language robot interaction built on Nvidia Isaac Sim.
InfiniteWorld encompasses a comprehensive set of physics asset construction
methods and generalized free robot interaction benchmarks. Specifically, we
first built a unified and scalable simulation framework for embodied learning
that integrates a series of improvements in generation-driven 3D asset
construction, Real2Sim, automated annotation framework, and unified 3D asset
processing. This framework provides a unified and scalable platform for robot
interaction and learning. In addition, to simulate realistic robot interaction,
we build four new general benchmarks, including scene graph collaborative
exploration and open-world social mobile manipulation. The former is often
overlooked as an important task for robots to explore the environment and build
scene knowledge, while the latter simulates robot interaction tasks with
different levels of knowledge agents based on the former. They can more
comprehensively evaluate the embodied agent's capabilities in environmental
understanding, task planning and execution, and intelligent interaction. We
hope that this work can provide the community with a systematic asset
interface, alleviate the dilemma of the lack of high-quality assets, and
provide a more comprehensive evaluation of robot interactions.

sparse online observations is essential for robot task planning and execution
in novel environments. However, existing methods that leverage differentiable
simulators to identify world models are incapable of jointly optimizing the
shape, appearance, and physical properties of the scene. In this work, we
introduce a novel object representation that allows the joint identification of
these properties. Our method employs a novel differentiable point-based object
representation coupled with a grid-based appearance field, which allows
differentiable object collision detection and rendering. Combined with a
differentiable physical simulator, we achieve end-to-end optimization of world
models, given the sparse visual and tactile observations of a physical motion
sequence. Through a series of system identification tasks in simulated and real
environments, we show that our method can learn both simulation- and
rendering-ready world models from only one robot action sequence.

robots with objects using advanced techniques in robotics and artificial
intelligence. The advent of powerful tools such as large language models (LLMs)
and large vision-language models (LVLMs) has significantly enhanced the
capabilities of these robots in environmental perception and decision-making.
However, the introduction of these intelligent agents has led to security
threats such as jailbreak attacks and adversarial attacks.
  In this research, we take a further step by proposing a backdoor attack
specifically targeting robotic manipulation and, for the first time,
implementing backdoor attack in the physical world. By embedding a backdoor
visual language model into the visual perception module within the robotic
system, we successfully mislead the robotic arm's operation in the physical
world, given the presence of common items as triggers. Experimental evaluations
in the physical world demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed backdoor

from those seen during training. We study the problem of adapting on-the-fly to
such novel scenarios during deployment, by drawing upon a diverse repertoire of
previouslylearned behaviors. Our approach, RObust Autonomous Modulation (ROAM),
introduces a mechanism based on the perceived value of pre-trained behaviors to
select and adapt pre-trained behaviors to the situation at hand. Crucially,
this adaptation process all happens within a single episode at test time,
without any human supervision. We demonstrate that ROAM enables a robot to
adapt rapidly to changes in dynamics both in simulation and on a real Go1
quadruped, even successfully moving forward with roller skates on its feet. Our
approach adapts over 2x as efficiently compared to existing methods when facing
a variety of out-of-distribution situations during deployment by effectively
choosing and adapting relevant behaviors on-the-fly.

models show significant variation in performance across different tasks and

through sophisticated prompt engineering, 2. all models struggle with complex

visual sensors, has seen significant advancements with the integration of
optical flow-based methods. However, its application remains limited by
inherent challenges, such as the necessity for a target image at test time, the
requirement of substantial overlap between initial and target images, and the
reliance on feedback from a single camera. This paper introduces Imagine2Servo,
an innovative approach leveraging diffusion-based image editing techniques to
enhance visual servoing algorithms by generating intermediate goal images. This
methodology allows for the extension of visual servoing applications beyond
traditional constraints, enabling tasks like long-range navigation and
manipulation without predefined goal images. We propose a pipeline that
synthesizes subgoal images grounded in the task at hand, facilitating servoing
in scenarios with minimal initial and target image overlap and integrating
multi-camera feedback for comprehensive task execution. Our contributions
demonstrate a novel application of image generation to robotic control,
significantly broadening the capabilities of visual servoing systems.
Real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of the
Imagine2Servo framework in accomplishing a variety of tasks, marking a notable
advancement in the field of visual servoing.

downstream robotics tasks, particularly tabletop manipulation problems. These
representations must be built from potentially noisy partial observations. In
this work, we focus on the problem of reconstructing a multi-object scene from
a single RGBD image, generally from a fixed camera in the scene. Traditional
scene representation methods generally cannot infer the geometry of unobserved
regions of the objects from the image. Attempts have been made to leverage deep
learning to train on a dataset of observed objects and representations, and
then generalize to new observations. However, this can be brittle to noisy
real-world observations and objects not contained in the dataset, and cannot
reason about their confidence. We propose BRRP, a reconstruction method that
leverages preexisting mesh datasets to build an informative prior during robust
probabilistic reconstruction. In order to make our method more efficient, we
introduce the concept of retrieval-augmented prior, where we retrieve relevant
components of our prior distribution during inference. The prior is used to
estimate the geometry of occluded portions of the in-scene objects. Our method
produces a distribution over object shape that can be used for reconstruction
or measuring uncertainty. We evaluate our method in both simulated scenes and
in the real world. We demonstrate the robustness of our method against deep
learning-only approaches while being more accurate than a method without an
informative prior.

                                        <span>  This paper addresses the challenge of teleoperating continuum instruments for
minimally invasive surgery (MIS). We develop and adopt a novel
task-priority-based kinematic formulation to quantitatively investigate
teleoperation commands for continuum instruments under remote center of motion
(RCM) constraints. Using redundancy resolution methods, we investigate the
kinematic performance during teleoperation, comparing linear and angular
commands within a task-priority scheme. For experimental validation, an
instrument module (IM) was designed and integrated with a 7-DoF manipulator.
  Assessments, simulations, and experimental validations demonstrated the
effectiveness of the proposed framework. The experiments involved several
tasks: trajectory tracking of the IM tip along multiple paths with varying
priorities for linear and angular teleoperation commands, pushing a ball along
predefined paths on a silicon board, following a pattern on a pegboard, and
guiding the continuum tip through rings on a ring board using a standard
surgical kit.

                                        <span>  Graph motif, defined as the microstructure that appears repeatedly in a large
graph, reveals important topological characteristics of the large graph and has
gained increasing attention in power system analysis regarding reliability,
vulnerability and resiliency. However, searching motifs within the large-scale
power system is extremely computationally challenging and even infeasible,
which undermines the value of motif analysis in practice. In this paper, we
introduce a two-stage AI-powered motif mining method to enable efficient and
wide-range motif analysis in power systems. In the first stage, a
representation learning method with specially designed network structure and
loss function is proposed to achieve ordered embedding for the power system
topology, simplifying the subgraph isomorphic problem into a vector comparison
problem. In the second stage, under the guidance of the ordered embedding
space, a greedy-search-based motif growing algorithm is introduced to quickly
obtain the motifs without traversal searching. A case study based on a power
system database including 61 circuit models demonstrates the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

                                        <span>  The deployment of distributed energy resource (DER) devices plays a critical
role in distribution grids, offering multiple value streams, including
decarbonization, provision of ancillary services, non-wire alternatives, and
enhanced grid flexibility. However, existing research on capacity expansion
suffers from two major limitations that undermine the realistic accuracy of the
proposed models: (i) the lack of modeling of three-phase unbalanced AC
distribution networks, and (ii) the absence of explicit treatment of model
uncertainty. To address these challenges, we develop a two-stage robust
optimization model that incorporates a 3-phase unbalanced power flow model for
solving the capacity expansion problem. Furthermore, we integrate a predictive
neural network with the optimization model in an end-to-end training framework
to handle uncertain variables with provable guarantees. Finally, we validate
the proposed framework using real-world power grid data collected from our
partner distribution system operators. The experimental results demonstrate
that our hybrid framework, which combines the strengths of optimization models
and neural networks, provides tractable decision-making support for DER
deployments in real-world scenarios.

based on the flexible correction-model predictive control algorithm (Fc-MPC).
This approach aims to overcome the limitations of existing combined navigation
methods that require prior geomagnetic maps and the inertial navigation drift
of long-range missions. The proposed method uses geomagnetic gradient
information and the model predictive control (MPC) algorithm with heading
control and state constraints, eliminating the dependence on prior geomagnetic
maps. Instead, the proposed method achieves real-time measurements of the
geomagnetic declination, geomagnetic inclination, and inertial navigation data
and introduces uniform compensation conditions to adjust and correct the
predictive results in real-time. Simulation and real experiment results
demonstrate that the proposed Fc-MPC algorithm significantly improves the
precision, efficiency, and stability of the geomagnetic and inertial combined
navigation system.

equitable evacuation planning has become more critical. This paper proposes a
data-driven, reinforcement learning-based framework to optimize bus-based
evacuations with an emphasis on improving both efficiency and equity. We model
the evacuation problem as a Markov Decision Process solved by reinforcement
learning, using real-time transit data from General Transit Feed Specification
and transportation networks extracted from OpenStreetMap. The reinforcement
learning agent dynamically reroutes buses from their scheduled location to
minimize total passengers' evacuation time while prioritizing equity-priority
communities. Simulations on the San Francisco Bay Area transportation network
indicate that the proposed framework achieves significant improvements in both
evacuation efficiency and equitable service distribution compared to
traditional rule-based and random strategies. These results highlight the
potential of reinforcement learning to enhance system performance and urban
resilience during emergency evacuations, offering a scalable solution for
real-world applications in intelligent transportation systems.

renewable energy resources in power system. However, as will be pointed out in
this letter, the conventional power-to-frequency (P-f) GFM control will face a
dilemma in keeping power limit and grid synchronization when the energy
resource of the converter reaches the limit. To address this challenge, a f-P
and Q-V hybrid control is proposed, which exhibits similar GFM performance,
particularly under weak grid condition, but is superior in power-limiting and
grid synchronization as demonstrated by comparative studies.

{\em anytime} convergence guarantees. For smooth (non-strongly) convex
optimization, we propose a stepsize schedule that allows gradient descent to
achieve convergence guarantees of $O(T^{-1.119})$ for any stopping time $T$,
where the stepsize schedule is predetermined without prior knowledge of the
stopping time. This result provides an affirmative answer to a COLT open
problem \citep{kornowski2024open} regarding whether stepsize-based acceleration
can yield anytime convergence rates of $o(T^{-1})$. We further extend our
theory to yield anytime convergence guarantees of
$\exp(-\Omega(T/\kappa^{0.893}))$ for smooth and strongly convex optimization,
with $\kappa$ being the condition number.

                                        <span>  Softmax attention is the principle backbone of foundation models for various
artificial intelligence applications, yet its quadratic complexity in sequence
length can limit its inference throughput in long-context settings. To address
this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space
Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as
more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist,
such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of
theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these
architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and
scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF),
which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common
representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new
insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance,
we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and
conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled
comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the
theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated.
Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and
mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic
development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.

gradient-based optimization of mean-square data prediction error (Full Waveform
Inversion or FWI) can fail to converge to useful model estimates if started
from an initial model predicting wave arrival times in error by more than half
a wavelength (a phenomenon known as cycle skipping). Matched Source Waveform
Inversion (MSWI) extends the wave propagation model by a filter that shifts
predicted waves to fit observed data. The MSWI objective adds a penalty for
deviation of this filter from the identity to the mean-square data misfit . The
extension allows the inversion to make large model adjustments while
maintaining data fit and so reduces the chances of local optimization iterates
stagnating at non-informative model estimates. Theory suggests that MSWI
applied to acoustic transmission data with single-arrival wavefronts may
produce an estimate of refractive index similar to the result of travel time
inversion, but without requiring explicit identification of travel times.
Numerical experiments conform to this expectation, in that MSWI applied to
single arrival transmission data gives reasonable model estimates in cases
where FWI fails. This MSWI model can then be used to jumpstart FWI for further
refinement of the model. The addition of moderate amounts of noise (30\%) does
not negatively impact MSWI's ability to converge. However, MSWI applied to data
with multiple arrivals is no longer theoretically equivalent to travel-time
tomography and exhibits the same tendency to cycle-skip as does FWI.

in the case when the corresponding reduced problems are solved using a bundle
method of nonsmooth optimization. The results obtained allow us to supply the

convergence to points satisfying a stationary condition. Both the theory and
computational implementation heavily rely on the notion of SCD (subspace

validated via a complex MPEC with equilibrium governed by a variational
inequality of the 2nd kind and by an academic bilevel program with a nonsmooth

                                        <span>  This work investigates a dynamical system functioning as a nonsmooth
adaptation of the continuous Newton method, aimed at minimizing the sum of a
primal lower-regular and a locally Lipschitz function, both potentially
nonsmooth. The classical Newton method's second-order information is extended
by incorporating the graphical derivative of a locally Lipschitz mapping.
Specifically, we analyze the existence and uniqueness of solutions, along with
the asymptotic behavior of the system's trajectories. Conditions for
convergence and respective convergence rates are established under two distinct
scenarios: strong metric subregularity and satisfaction of the
Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz inequality.

general probability spaces. The subproblems in this algorithm are allowed to be
calculated inexactly. It is found that the Halpern-type relaxed inertial
inexact PHA is closely related to the Halpern-type relaxed inertial inexact

                                        <span>  Coordinate descent algorithms are widely used in machine learning and
large-scale data analysis due to their strong optimality guarantees and
impressive empirical performance in solving non-convex problems. In this work,
we introduce Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) method for structured nonconvex
optimization with nonseparable constraints. Unlike traditional large-scale
Coordinate Descent (CD) approaches, we do not assume the constraints are
separable. Instead, we account for the possibility of nonlinear coupling among
them. By leveraging the inherent problem structure, we propose new CD methods
to tackle this specific challenge. Under the relatively mild condition of
locally bounded non-convexity, we demonstrate that achieving coordinate-wise
stationary points offer a stronger optimality criterion compared to standard
critical points. Furthermore, under the Luo-Tseng error bound conditions, our
BCD methods exhibit Q-linear convergence to coordinate-wise stationary points
or critical points. To demonstrate the practical utility of our methods, we
apply them to various machine learning and signal processing models. We also
provide the geometry analysis for the models. Experiments on real-world data
consistently demonstrate the superior objective values of our approaches
compared to existing methods.

                                        <span>  We show that for separable convex optimization, random stepsizes fully
accelerate Gradient Descent. Specifically, using inverse stepsizes i.i.d. from
the Arcsine distribution improves the iteration complexity from $O(k)$ to
$O(k^{1/2})$, where $k$ is the condition number. No momentum or other
algorithmic modifications are required. This result is incomparable to the
(deterministic) Silver Stepsize Schedule which does not require separability
but only achieves partial acceleration $O(k^{\log_{1+\sqrt{2}} 2}) \approx
O(k^{0.78})$. Our starting point is a conceptual connection to potential
theory: the variational characterization for the distribution of stepsizes with
fastest convergence rate mirrors the variational characterization for the
distribution of charged particles with minimal logarithmic potential energy.
The Arcsine distribution solves both variational characterizations due to a
remarkable "equalization property" which in the physical context amounts to a
constant potential over space, and in the optimization context amounts to an
identical convergence rate over all quadratic functions. A key technical
insight is that martingale arguments extend this phenomenon to all separable
convex functions. We interpret this equalization as an extreme form of hedging:
by using this random distribution over stepsizes, Gradient Descent converges at
exactly the same rate for all functions in the function class.

Building on prior work that demonstrates how Transformers can simulate
preconditioned gradient descent, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence
that Memformers can learn more advanced optimization algorithms. Specifically,
we analyze how memory registers in Memformers store suitable intermediate
attention values allowing them to implement algorithms such as conjugate
gradient. Our results show that Memformers can efficiently learn these methods
by training on random linear regression tasks, even learning methods that
outperform conjugate gradient. This work extends our knowledge about the
algorithmic capabilities of Transformers, showing how they can learn complex
optimization methods.

widely used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method and has found numerous
applications in Machine Learning. However, it is notoriously known that this
method fails to converge in non-convex settings where the stochastic noise is
significant (i.e. when only small or bounded batch sizes are used). In this
paper, we focus on the stochastic proximal gradient method with Polyak
momentum. We prove this method attains an optimal convergence rate for
non-convex composite optimization problems, regardless of batch size.
Additionally, we rigorously analyze the variance reduction effect of the Polyak
momentum in the composite optimization setting and we show the method also
converges when the proximal step can only be solved inexactly. Finally, we
provide numerical experiments to validate our theoretical results.

                                        <span>  This work revisits the classical low-rank matrix factorization problem and
unveils the critical role of initialization in shaping convergence rates for
such nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization. We introduce Nystrom initialization,
which significantly improves the global convergence of Scaled Gradient Descent
(ScaledGD) in both symmetric and asymmetric matrix factorization tasks.
Specifically, we prove that ScaledGD with Nystrom initialization achieves
quadratic convergence in cases where only linear rates were previously known.
Furthermore, we extend this initialization to low-rank adapters (LoRA) commonly
used for finetuning foundation models. Our approach, NoRA, i.e., LoRA with
Nystrom initialization, demonstrates superior performance across various
downstream tasks and model scales, from 1B to 7B parameters, in large language
and diffusion models.

                                        <span>  The optimal policy in various real-world strategic decision-making problems
depends both on the environmental configuration and exogenous events. For these
settings, we introduce Contextual Bilevel Reinforcement Learning (CB-RL), a
stochastic bilevel decision-making model, where the lower level consists of
solving a contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP). CB-RL can be viewed as a
Stackelberg Game where the leader and a random context beyond the leader's
control together decide the setup of many MDPs that potentially multiple
followers best respond to. This framework extends beyond traditional bilevel
optimization and finds relevance in diverse fields such as RLHF, tax design,
reward shaping, contract theory and mechanism design. We propose a stochastic
Hyper Policy Gradient Descent (HPGD) algorithm to solve CB-RL, and demonstrate
its convergence. Notably, HPGD uses stochastic hypergradient estimates, based
on observations of the followers' trajectories. Therefore, it allows followers
to use any training procedure and the leader to be agnostic of the specific
algorithm, which aligns with various real-world scenarios. We further consider
the setting when the leader can influence the training of followers and propose
an accelerated algorithm. We empirically demonstrate the performance of our
algorithm for reward shaping and tax design.

                                        <span>  This paper considers an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) that
allows for general non-exponential discount functions, in both discrete and
continuous time. Due to the inherent time inconsistency, we look for a
randomized equilibrium policy (i.e., relaxed equilibrium) in an intra-personal
game between an agent's current and future selves. When we modify the MDP by
entropy regularization, a relaxed equilibrium is shown to exist by a nontrivial
entropy estimate. As the degree of regularization diminishes, the
entropy-regularized MDPs approximate the original MDP, which gives the general
existence of a relaxed equilibrium in the limit by weak convergence arguments.
As opposed to prior studies that consider only deterministic policies, our
existence of an equilibrium does not require any convexity (or concavity) of
the controlled transition probabilities and reward function. Interestingly,
this benefit of considering randomized policies is unique to the
time-inconsistent case.

asymmetry measure of the gauge. We obtain quantitative results indicating how
far a corrupted Fermat-Weber point can lie from the true value in terms of the
original sample and the size of the corrupted part. If the distance from the

`uniformly robust.' We show that polyhedral gauges are uniformly robust, but
locally strictly convex norms are not, while in dimension 2 any uniform robust

optimization, we propose a stepsize schedule that allows gradient descent to
achieve convergence guarantees of $O(T^{-1.119})$ for any stopping time $T$,
where the stepsize schedule is predetermined without prior knowledge of the
stopping time. This result provides an affirmative answer to a COLT open

can yield anytime convergence rates of $o(T^{-1})$. We further extend our
theory to yield anytime convergence guarantees of
$\exp(-\Omega(T/\kappa^{0.893}))$ for smooth and strongly convex optimization,
with $\kappa$ being the condition number.

chance-constrained optimization, maintaining convexity without requiring
assumptions about the probability distribution of uncertain parameters.
However, the approach can demand large sample sizes, making it intractable for
safety-critical applications that require very low levels of constraint
violation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel yet simple constraint
scaling method, inspired by large deviations theory. Under mild nonparametric
conditions on the underlying probability distribution, we show that our method
yields an exponential reduction in sample size requirements for bilinear
constraints with low violation levels compared to the classical approach,
thereby significantly improving computational tractability. Numerical
experiments on robust pole assignment problems support our theoretical
findings.

                                        <span>  In the Network Revenue Management (NRM) problem, products composed of up to L
resources are sold to stochastically arriving customers. We take a randomized
rounding approach to NRM, motivated by the modern tool of Online Contention
Resolution Schemes (OCRS). The goal is to take a fractional solution to NRM
that satisfies the resource constraints in expectation, and implement it in an
online policy that satisfies the resource constraints with probability 1, while
(approximately) preserving all of the sales that were prescribed by the
fractional solution.
  In NRM problems, customer substitution induces a negative correlation between
products being demanded, making it difficult to apply the standard definition
of OCRS. We start by deriving a more powerful notion of "random-element" OCRS
that achieves a guarantee of 1/(1+L) for NRM with customer substitution,
matching a common benchmark in the literature. We show this benchmark is
unbeatable for all integers L that are the power of a prime number. We then
show how to beat this benchmark under three widely applied assumptions.
Finally, we show that under several assumptions, it is possible to do better
than offline CRS when L>= 5.
  Our results have corresponding implications for Online Combinatorial
Auctions, in which buyers bid for bundles of up to L items, and buyers being
single-minded is akin to having no substitution. Our result under the
assumption that products comprise one item from each of up to L groups implies
that 1/(1+L) can be beaten for Prophet Inequality on the intersection of L
partition matroids, a problem of interest. In sum, our paper shows how to apply
OCRS to all of these problems and establishes a surprising separation in the
achievable guarantees when substitution is involved, under general resource
constraints parametrized by L.

asymptotically optimal sampling-based motion planning algorithm. Capitalizing
on the strengths of \emph{meet-in-the-middle} property in bidirectional
heuristic search with a new lazy strategy, and uniform-cost search, BIGIT*
constructs an implicitly bidirectional preliminary motion tree on an implicit
random geometric graph (RGG). This efficiently tightens the informed search
region, serving as an admissible and accurate bidirectional guidance heuristic.
This heuristic is subsequently utilized to guide a bidirectional heuristic
search in finding a valid path on the given RGG. Experiments show that BIGIT*
outperforms the existing informed sampling-based motion planners both in faster
finding an initial solution and converging to the optimum on simulated abstract
problems in $\mathbb{R}^{16}$. Practical drone flight path planning tasks
across a campus also verify our results.

                                        <span>  This paper develops a Time Shift Governor (TSG)-based control scheme to
enforce constraints during rendezvous and docking (RD) missions in the setting
of the Two-Body problem. As an add-on scheme to the nominal closed-loop system,
the TSG generates a time-shifted Chief spacecraft trajectory as a target
reference for the Deputy spacecraft. This modification of the commanded
reference trajectory ensures that constraints are enforced while the time shift
is reduced to zero to effect the rendezvous. Our approach to TSG implementation
integrates an LSTM neural network which approximates the time shift parameter
as a function of a sequence of past Deputy and Chief spacecraft states. This
LSTM neural network is trained offline from simulation data. We report
simulation results for RD missions in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and on the
Molniya orbit to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.
The proposed scheme reduces the time to compute the time shift parameter in
most of the scenarios and successfully completes rendezvous missions.

                                        <span>  Rewards remain an uninterpretable way to specify tasks for Reinforcement
Learning, as humans are often unable to predict the optimal behavior of any
given reward function, leading to poor reward design and reward hacking.
Language presents an appealing way to communicate intent to agents and bypass
reward design, but prior efforts to do so have been limited by costly and
unscalable labeling efforts. In this work, we propose a method for a completely
unsupervised alternative to grounding language instructions in a zero-shot
manner to obtain policies. We present a solution that takes the form of
imagine, project, and imitate: The agent imagines the observation sequence
corresponding to the language description of a task, projects the imagined
sequence to our target domain, and grounds it to a policy. Video-language
models allow us to imagine task descriptions that leverage knowledge of tasks
learned from internet-scale video-text mappings. The challenge remains to
ground these generations to a policy. In this work, we show that we can achieve
a zero-shot language-to-behavior policy by first grounding the imagined
sequences in real observations of an unsupervised RL agent and using a
closed-form solution to imitation learning that allows the RL agent to mimic
the grounded observations. Our method, RLZero, is the first to our knowledge to
show zero-shot language to behavior generation abilities without any
supervision on a variety of tasks on simulated domains. We further show that
RLZero can also generate policies zero-shot from cross-embodied videos such as
those scraped from YouTube.

                                        <span>  The primary goal of motion planning is to generate safe and efficient
trajectories for vehicles. Traditionally, motion planning models are trained
using imitation learning to mimic the behavior of human experts. However, these
models often lack interpretability and fail to provide clear justifications for
their decisions. We propose a method that integrates constraint learning into
imitation learning by extracting driving constraints from expert trajectories.
Our approach utilizes vectorized scene embeddings that capture critical spatial
and temporal features, enabling the model to identify and generalize
constraints across various driving scenarios. We formulate the constraint
learning problem using a maximum entropy model, which scores the motion
planner's trajectories based on their similarity to the expert trajectory. By
separating the scoring process into distinct reward and constraint streams, we
improve both the interpretability of the planner's behavior and its attention
to relevant scene components. Unlike existing constraint learning methods that
rely on simulators and are typically embedded in reinforcement learning (RL) or
inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) frameworks, our method operates without
simulators, making it applicable to a wider range of datasets and real-world
scenarios. Experimental results on the InD and TrafficJams datasets demonstrate
that incorporating driving constraints enhances model interpretability and
improves closed-loop performance.

                                        <span>  Traditional locomotion strategies become ineffective at low Reynolds numbers,
where viscous forces predominate over inertial forces. To adapt, microorganisms
have evolved specialized structures like cilia and flagella for efficient
maneuvering in viscous environments. Among these organisms, Phytophthora
zoospores demonstrate unique locomotion mechanisms that allow them to rapidly
spread and attack new hosts while expending minimal energy. In this study, we
present the design, fabrication, and testing of a zoospore-inspired robot,
which leverages dual flexible flagella and oscillatory propulsion mechanisms to
emulate the natural swimming behavior of zoospores. Our experiments and
theoretical model reveal that both flagellar length and oscillation frequency
strongly influence the robot's propulsion speed, with longer flagella and
higher frequencies yielding enhanced performance. Additionally, the anterior
flagellum, which generates a pulling force on the body, plays a dominant role
in enhancing propulsion efficiency compared to the posterior flagellum's
pushing force. This is a significant experimental finding, as it would be
challenging to observe directly in biological zoospores, which spontaneously
release the posterior flagellum when the anterior flagellum detaches. This work
contributes to the development of advanced microscale robotic systems with
potential applications in medical, environmental, and industrial fields. It
also provides a valuable platform for studying biological zoospores and their
unique locomotion strategies.

                                        <span>  Recent work in Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown that a unified
Transformer trained under a masked auto-encoding objective can effectively
capture the relationships between different modalities (e.g., states, actions,
rewards) within given trajectory datasets. However, this information has not
been fully exploited during the inference phase, where the agent needs to
generate an optimal policy instead of just reconstructing masked components
from unmasked ones. Given that a pretrained trajectory model can act as both a
Policy Model and a World Model with appropriate mask patterns, we propose using
Model Predictive Control (MPC) at test time to leverage the model's own
predictive capability to guide its action selection. Empirical results on D4RL
and RoboMimic show that our inference-phase MPC significantly improves the
decision-making performance of a pretrained trajectory model without any
additional parameter training. Furthermore, our framework can be adapted to
Offline to Online (O2O) RL and Goal Reaching RL, resulting in more substantial
performance gains when an additional online interaction budget is provided, and
better generalization capabilities when different task targets are specified.

particularly in real-world applications that require a high degree of
reliability and structure. However, traditional manual FSM design and
modification processes can be time-consuming and error-prone. We propose that
large language models (LLMs) can assist developers in editing FSM code for
real-world robotic use cases. LLMs, with their ability to use context and
process natural language, offer a solution for FSM modification with high
correctness, allowing developers to update complex control logic through
natural language instructions. Our approach leverages few-shot prompting and
language-guided code generation to reduce the amount of time it takes to edit
an FSM. To validate this approach, we evaluate it on a real-world robotics
dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical scenarios.

generally categorized into high-level category-specific search and low-level
language-guided navigation, depending on the granularity of language
instruction, in which the former emphasizes the exploration process, while the
latter concentrates on following detailed textual commands. Despite the
differing focuses of these tasks, the underlying requirements of interpreting
instructions, comprehending the surroundings, and inferring action decisions
remain consistent. This paper consolidates diverse navigation tasks into a
unified and generic framework -- we investigate the core difficulties of
sharing general knowledge and exploiting task-specific capabilities in learning
navigation and propose a novel State-Adaptive Mixture of Experts (SAME) model
that effectively enables an agent to infer decisions based on
different-granularity language and dynamic observations. Powered by SAME, we
present a versatile agent capable of addressing seven navigation tasks
simultaneously that outperforms or achieves highly comparable performance to
task-specific agents.

                                        <span>  Learning behavior in legged robots presents a significant challenge due to
its inherent instability and complex constraints. Recent research has proposed
the use of a large language model (LLM) to generate reward functions in
reinforcement learning, thereby replacing the need for manually designed
rewards by experts. However, this approach, which relies on textual
descriptions to define learning objectives, fails to achieve controllable and
precise behavior learning with clear directionality. In this paper, we
introduce a new video2reward method, which directly generates reward functions
from videos depicting the behaviors to be mimicked and learned. Specifically,
we first process videos containing the target behaviors, converting the motion
information of individuals in the videos into keypoint trajectories represented
as coordinates through a video2text transforming module. These trajectories are
then fed into an LLM to generate the reward function, which in turn is used to
train the policy. To enhance the quality of the reward function, we develop a
video-assisted iterative reward refinement scheme that visually assesses the
learned behaviors and provides textual feedback to the LLM. This feedback
guides the LLM to continually refine the reward function, ultimately
facilitating more efficient behavior learning. Experimental results on tasks
involving bipedal and quadrupedal robot motion control demonstrate that our
method surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art LLM-based reward
generation methods by over 37.6% in terms of human normalized score. More
importantly, by switching video inputs, we find our method can rapidly learn
diverse motion behaviors such as walking and running.

leverages a cluster-based point cloud registration model that tracks the 6-DoF

particularly benefiting individuals with visual impairments through
sonification. This paper presents a novel mapping framework that accurately
represents spatial geometry for sonification, transforming physical spaces into
auditory experiences. By leveraging depth sensors, we convert incrementally
built 3D scenes into a compact 360-degree representation based on angular and
distance information, aligning with human auditory perception. Our proposed
mapping framework utilises a sensor-centric structure, maintaining 2D circular
or 3D cylindrical representations, and employs the VDB-GPDF for efficient
online mapping. We introduce two sonification modes-circular ranging and
circular ranging of objects-along with real-time user control over auditory
filters. Incorporating binaural room impulse responses, our framework provides
perceptually robust auditory feedback. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate superior performance in accuracy, coverage, and timing compared to
existing approaches, with effective handling of dynamic objects. The
accompanying video showcases the practical application of spatial sonification
in room-like environments.

                                        <span>  This paper introduces Point-GN, a novel non-parametric network for efficient
and accurate 3D point cloud classification. Unlike conventional deep learning
models that rely on a large number of trainable parameters, Point-GN leverages
non-learnable components-specifically, Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), k-Nearest
Neighbors (k-NN), and Gaussian Positional Encoding (GPE)-to extract both local
and global geometric features. This design eliminates the need for additional
training while maintaining high performance, making Point-GN particularly
suited for real-time, resource-constrained applications. We evaluate Point-GN
on two benchmark datasets, ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN, achieving
classification accuracies of 85.29% and 85.89%, respectively, while
significantly reducing computational complexity. Point-GN outperforms existing
non-parametric methods and matches the performance of fully trained models, all
with zero learnable parameters. Our results demonstrate that Point-GN is a
promising solution for 3D point cloud classification in practical, real-time
environments.

                                        <span>  Humans can steadily and gently grasp unfamiliar objects based on tactile
perception. Robots still face challenges in achieving similar performance due
to the difficulty of learning accurate grasp-force predictions and force
control strategies that can be generalized from limited data. In this article,
we propose an approach for learning grasping from ideal force control
demonstrations, to achieve similar performance of human hands with limited data
size. Our approach utilizes objects with known contact characteristics to
automatically generate reference force curves without human demonstrations. In
addition, we design the dual convolutional neural networks (Dual-CNN)
architecture which incorporats a physics-based mechanics module for learning
target grasping force predictions from demonstrations. The described method can
be effectively applied in vision-based tactile sensors and enables gentle and
stable grasping of objects from the ground. The described prediction model and
grasping strategy were validated in offline evaluations and online experiments,
and the accuracy and generalizability were demonstrated.

                                        <span>  This paper develops a Time Shift Governor (TSG)-based control scheme to
enforce constraints during rendezvous and docking (RD) missions in the setting
of the Two-Body problem. As an add-on scheme to the nominal closed-loop system,
the TSG generates a time-shifted Chief spacecraft trajectory as a target
reference for the Deputy spacecraft. This modification of the commanded
reference trajectory ensures that constraints are enforced while the time shift
is reduced to zero to effect the rendezvous. Our approach to TSG implementation
integrates an LSTM neural network which approximates the time shift parameter
as a function of a sequence of past Deputy and Chief spacecraft states. This
LSTM neural network is trained offline from simulation data. We report
simulation results for RD missions in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and on the
Molniya orbit to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.
The proposed scheme reduces the time to compute the time shift parameter in
most of the scenarios and successfully completes rendezvous missions.

that leverages di/dz feedback. By superimposing a high-frequency sinusoidal
modulation on the control signal, we extract the amplitude of the resulting
tunneling current to obtain a di/dz measurement as the tip is scanned over the
surface. A feedback control loop is then closed to maintain a constant di/dz,
enhancing the sensitivity of the tip to subtle surface variations throughout a
scan. This approach offers distinct advantages over conventional
constant-current imaging. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique
through high-resolution imaging and lithographic experiments on several
Si(100)-2x1:H surfaces. Our findings, validated across multiple STM systems and
imaging conditions, pave the way for a new paradigm in STM control, imaging,

                                        <span>  Recent work in Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown that a unified
Transformer trained under a masked auto-encoding objective can effectively
capture the relationships between different modalities (e.g., states, actions,
rewards) within given trajectory datasets. However, this information has not
been fully exploited during the inference phase, where the agent needs to
generate an optimal policy instead of just reconstructing masked components
from unmasked ones. Given that a pretrained trajectory model can act as both a
Policy Model and a World Model with appropriate mask patterns, we propose using
Model Predictive Control (MPC) at test time to leverage the model's own
predictive capability to guide its action selection. Empirical results on D4RL
and RoboMimic show that our inference-phase MPC significantly improves the
decision-making performance of a pretrained trajectory model without any
additional parameter training. Furthermore, our framework can be adapted to
Offline to Online (O2O) RL and Goal Reaching RL, resulting in more substantial
performance gains when an additional online interaction budget is provided, and
better generalization capabilities when different task targets are specified.

                                        <span>  This work introduces an error feedback approach for reducing quantization
noise of distributed graph filters. It comes from error spectrum shaping
techniques from state-space digital filters, and therefore establishes
connections between quantized filtering processes over different domains.
Quantization noise expression incorporating error feedback for finite impulse
response (FIR) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) graph filters are both
derived with regard to time-invariant and time-varying graph topologies.
Theoretical analysis is provided, and closed-form error weight coefficients are
found. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method in noise reduction for the graph filters regardless of the deterministic
and random graph topologies.

                                        <span>  In this paper we study the asymptotics of linear regression in settings with
non-Gaussian covariates where the covariates exhibit a linear dependency
structure, departing from the standard assumption of independence. We model the
covariates using stochastic processes with spatio-temporal covariance and
analyze the performance of ridge regression in the high-dimensional
proportional regime, where the number of samples and feature dimensions grow
proportionally. A Gaussian universality theorem is proven, demonstrating that
the asymptotics are invariant under replacing the non-Gaussian covariates with
Gaussian vectors preserving mean and covariance, for which tools from random
matrix theory can be used to derive precise characterizations of the estimation
error. The estimation error is characterized by a fixed-point equation
involving the spectral properties of the spatio-temporal covariance matrices,
enabling efficient computation. We then study optimal regularization,
overparameterization, and the double descent phenomenon in the context of
dependent data. Simulations validate our theoretical predictions, shedding
light on how dependencies influence estimation error and the choice of
regularization parameters.

                                        <span>  In systems modelling, a 'system' typically comprises located resources
relative to which processes execute. One important use of logic in informatics
is in modelling such systems for the purpose of reasoning (perhaps automated)
about their behaviour and properties. To this end, one requires an
interpretation of logical formulae in terms of the resources and states of the
system; such an interpretation is called a 'resource semantics' of the logic.
This paper shows how inferentialism -- the view that meaning is given in terms
of inferential behaviour -- enables a versatile and expressive framework for
resource semantics. Specifically, how inferentialism seamlessly incorporates
the assertion-based approach of the logic of Bunched Implications, foundational
in program verification (e.g., as the basis of Separation Logic), and the
renowned number-of-uses reading of Linear Logic. This integration enables
reasoning about shared and separated resources in intuitive and familiar ways,
as well as about the composition and interfacing of system components.

unknown noise distributions and joint chance constraints using conformal
prediction. Our approach involves designing a feedback controller to maintain
an error system within a prediction region (PR). We define PRs as sublevel sets
of a nonconformity score over error trajectories, enabling the handling of
joint chance constraints. We propose two methods to design feedback control and
PRs: one through direct optimization over error trajectory samples, and the
other indirectly using the $S$-procedure with a disturbance ellipsoid obtained
from data. By tightening constraints with PRs, we solve a relaxed problem to
synthesize a feedback policy. Our method ensures reliable probabilistic
guarantees based on marginal coverage, independent of data size.

                                        <span>  Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been envisioned as a key
technology in future wireless communication networks to enable smart radio
environment. To further enhance the passive beamforming capability of RIS,
beyond diagonal (BD)-RIS has been proposed considering reconfigurable
interconnections among different RIS elements. BD-RIS has a unique feature that
cannot be enabled by conventional diagonal RIS; it can be realized by
non-reciprocal circuits and thus enables an asymmetric scattering matrix. This
feature provides the capability to break the wireless channel reciprocity, and
has the potential to benefit full-duplex (FD) systems. In this paper, we model
the BD RIS-assisted FD systems, where the impact of BD-RIS non-reciprocity and
that of structural scattering, which refers to the specular reflection
generated by RIS when the RIS is turned OFF, are explicitly captured. To assess
the benefits of non-reciprocal BD-RIS, we optimise the scattering matrix,
precoder and combiner to maximize the DL and UL sum-rates in the FD system. To
tackle this optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on
block coordination descent (BCD) and penalty dual decomposition (PDD).
Numerical results demonstrate surprising benefits of non-reciprocal BD-RIS that
it can achieve much higher DL and UL sum-rates in the FD scenario than
reciprocal BD-RIS and conventional diagonal RIS.

                                        <span>  Homotopy methods are attractive due to their capability of solving difficult
optimisation and optimal control problems. The underlying idea is to construct
a homotopy, which may be considered as a continuous (zero) curve between the
difficult original problem and a related, comparatively easy one. Then, the
solution of the easier one is continuously perturbed along the zero curve
towards the sought-after solution of the original problem. We propose a
methodology for the systematic construction of such zero curves for
discrete-time optimal control problems drawing upon the theory of globally
convergent homotopies for nonlinear programs. The proposed framework ensures
that for almost every initial guess at a solution there exists a suitable
homotopy path that is, in addition, numerically convenient to track. We
demonstrate the results by solving optimal path planning problems for a linear
system and the nonlinear nonholonomic car (Dubins' vehicle).

                                        <span>  In this paper, we introduce an inexact approach to the Boosted Difference of
Convex Functions Algorithm (BDCA) for solving nonconvex and nondifferentiable
problems involving the difference of two convex functions (DC functions).
Specifically, when the first DC component is differentiable and the second may
be nondifferentiable, BDCA utilizes the solution from the subproblem of the DC
Algorithm (DCA) to define a descent direction for the objective function. A
monotone linesearch is then performed to find a new point that improves the
objective function relative to the subproblem solution. This approach enhances
the performance of DCA. However, if the first DC component is
nondifferentiable, the BDCA direction may become an ascent direction, rendering
the monotone linesearch ineffective. To address this, we propose an Inexact
nonmonotone Boosted Difference of Convex Algorithm (InmBDCA). This algorithm
incorporates two main features of inexactness: First, the subproblem therein is
solved approximately allowing us for a controlled relative error tolerance in
defining the linesearch direction. Second, an inexact nonmonotone linesearch
scheme is used to determine the step size for the next iteration. Under
suitable assumptions, we demonstrate that InmBDCA is well-defined, with any
accumulation point of the sequence generated by InmBDCA being a critical point
of the problem. We also provide iteration-complexity bounds for the algorithm.
Numerical experiments show that InmBDCA outperforms both the nonsmooth BDCA
(nmBDCA) and the monotone version of DCA in practical scenarios.

                                        <span>  Many classical and modern machine learning algorithms require solving
optimization tasks under orthogonality constraints. Solving these tasks with
feasible methods requires a gradient descent update followed by a retraction
operation on the Stiefel manifold, which can be computationally expensive.
Recently, an infeasible retraction-free approach, termed the landing algorithm,
was proposed as an efficient alternative. Motivated by the common occurrence of
orthogonality constraints in tasks such as principle component analysis and
training of deep neural networks, this paper studies the landing algorithm and
establishes a novel linear convergence rate for smooth non-convex functions
using only a local Riemannian P{\L} condition. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the landing algorithm performs on par with the
state-of-the-art retraction-based methods with substantially reduced
computational overhead.

                                        <span>  We present a novel framework that combines machine learning with
mixed-integer optimization to solve the Capacitated Location-Routing Problem
(CLRP). The CLRP is a classical yet NP-hard problem that integrates strategic
facility location with operational vehicle routing decisions, aiming to
simultaneously minimize both fixed and variable costs. The proposed method
first trains a permutationally invariant neural network that approximates the
vehicle routing cost for serving any arbitrary subset of customers by any
candidate facility. The trained neural network is then used as a surrogate
within a mixed-integer optimization problem, which is reformulated and solved
using off-the-shelf solvers. The framework is simple, scalable, and requires no
routing-specific knowledge or parameter tuning. Computational experiments on
large-scale benchmark instances confirm the effectiveness of our approach.
Using only 10,000 training samples generated by an off-the-shelf vehicle
routing heuristic and a one-time training cost of approximately 2 wall-clock
hours, the method provides location-allocation decisions that are within 1% of
the best-known solutions for large problems in less than 5 seconds on average.
The findings suggest that the neural-embedded framework can be a viable method
for tackling integrated location and routing problems at scale. Our code and
data are publicly available.

extending well-known results, previously established for a finite number of

extension is achieved using the Dini differentiability concept which is more
general than Fr\'echet or G\^ateaux differentiability. We will illustrate our
results by giving examples of optimisation problems with a finite or countable
number of inequality constraints where the functions are not
Gateaux-differentiable but only upper Dini-differentiable.

this paper pioneers a unified slot machine framework for global optimization by
transforming the search for global optimizer(s) to the optimal strategy
formulation of a bandit process in infinite policy sets and proves that
two-armed bandit is enough. By leveraging the strategic bandit process-driven
optimization framework, we introduce a new {\bf S}trategic {\bf M}onte {\bf
C}arlo {\bf O}ptimization (SMCO) algorithm that coordinate-wisely generates
points from multiple paired distributions and can be implemented parallel for
high-dimensional continuous functions. Our SMCO algorithm, equipped with tree
search that broadens the optimal policy search space of slot machine for
attaining the global optimizer(s) of a multi-modal function, facilitates fast
learning via trial and error. We provide a strategic law of large numbers for
nonlinear expectations in bandit settings, and establish that our SMCO
algorithm converges to global optimizer(s) almost surely. Unlike the standard
gradient descent ascent (GDA) that uses a one-leg walk to climb the mountain
and is sensitive to starting points and step sizes, our SMCO algorithm takes a
two-leg walk to the peak by using the two-sided sampling from the paired
distributions and is not sensitive to initial point selection or step size
constraints. Numerical studies demonstrate that the new SMCO algorithm
outperforms GDA, particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing in both
convergence accuracy and speed. Our SMCO algorithm should be extremely useful
for finding optimal tuning parameters in many large scale complex optimization
problems.

                                        <span>  Quantum computing has long promised to revolutionize the way we solve complex
problems. At the same time, tensor networks are widely used across various
fields due to their computational efficiency and capacity to represent
intricate systems. While both technologies can address similar problems, the
primary aim of this thesis is not to compare them. Such comparison would be
unfair, as quantum devices are still in an early stage, whereas tensor network
algorithms represent the state-of-the-art in quantum simulation. Instead, we
explore a potential synergy between these technologies, focusing on how two
flagship algorithms from each paradigm, the Density Matrix Renormalization
Group (DMRG) and quantum annealing, might collaborate in the future.
Furthermore, a significant challenge in the DMRG algorithm is identifying an
appropriate tensor network representation for the quantum system under study.
The representation commonly used is called Matrix Product Operator (MPO), and
it is notoriously difficult to obtain for certain systems. This thesis outlines
an approach to this problem using finite automata, which we apply to construct
the MPO for our case study. Finally, we present a practical application of this
framework through the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP). Despite its apparent
simplicity, the QKP is a fundamental problem in computer science with numerous
practical applications. In addition to quantum annealing and the DMRG
algorithm, we implement a dynamic programming approach to evaluate the quality
of our results. Our results highlight the power of tensor networks and the
potential of quantum annealing for solving optimization problems. Moreover,
this thesis is designed to be self-explanatory, ensuring that readers with a
solid mathematical background can fully understand the content without prior
knowledge of quantum mechanics.

spaces of functions, achieving much success in the field of scientific
computing. Compared to certain deep learning-based solvers, such as
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Deep Ritz Method (DRM), neural
operators can solve a class of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Although
much work has been done to analyze the approximation and generalization error
of neural operators, there is still a lack of analysis on their training error.
In this work, we conduct the convergence analysis of gradient descent for the
wide shallow neural operators within the framework of Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK). The core idea lies on the fact that over-parameterization and random
initialization together ensure that each weight vector remains near its
initialization throughout all iterations, yielding the linear convergence of
gradient descent. In this work, we demonstrate that under the setting of

of whether it is in continuous time or discrete time.

                                        <span>  Advancements in computational fluid mechanics have largely relied on
Newtonian frameworks, particularly through the direct simulation of
Navier-Stokes equations. In this work, we propose an alternative computational
framework that employs variational methods, specifically by leveraging the
principle of minimum pressure gradient, which turns the fluid mechanics problem
into a minimization problem whose solution can be used to predict the flow
field in unsteady incompressible viscous flows.
  This method exhibits two particulary intriguing properties. First, it
circumvents the chronic issues of pressure-velocity coupling in incompressible
flows, which often dominates the computational cost in computational fluid
dynamics (CFD). Second, this method eliminates the reliance on unphysical
assumptions at the outflow boundary, addressing another longstanding challenge
in CFD.
  We apply this framework to three benchmark examples across a range of
Reynolds numbers: (i) unsteady flow field in a lid-driven cavity, (ii)
Poiseuille flow, and (iii) flow past a circular cylinder. The minimization
framework is carried out using a physics-informed neural network (PINN), which
integrates the underlying physical principles directly into the training of the
model. The results from the proposed method are validated against high-fidelity
CFD simulations, showing an excellent agreement. Comparison of the proposed
variational method to the conventional method, wherein PINNs is directly
applied to solve Navier-Stokes Equations, reveals that the proposed method
outperforms conventional PINNs in terms of both convergence rate and time,
demonstrating its potential for solving complex fluid mechanics problems.

                                        <span>  Surprisingly, recent work has shown that gradient descent can be accelerated
without using momentum -- just by judiciously choosing stepsizes. An open
question raised by several papers is whether this phenomenon of stepsize-based
acceleration holds more generally for constrained and/or composite convex
optimization via projected and/or proximal versions of gradient descent. We
answer this in the affirmative by proving that the silver stepsize schedule
yields analogously accelerated rates in these settings. These rates are
conjectured to be asymptotically optimal among all stepsize schedules, and
match the silver convergence rate of vanilla gradient descent (Altschuler and
Parrilo, 2023), namely $O(\varepsilon^{- \log_{\rho} 2})$ for smooth convex
optimization and $O(\kappa^{\log_\rho 2} \log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ under
strong convexity, where $\varepsilon$ is the precision, $\kappa$ is the
condition number, and $\rho = 1 + \sqrt{2}$ is the silver ratio. The key
technical insight is the combination of recursive gluing -- the technique
underlying all analyses of gradient descent accelerated with time-varying
stepsizes -- with a certain Laplacian-structured sum-of-squares certificate for
the analysis of proximal point updates.

systems, focusing on dynamic uncertainties in the control directions \emph{and}
the presence of topological obstructions that prevent the existence of smooth
global control Lyapunov functions. Building on a recently developed Lie-bracket
averaging result for hybrid dynamic inclusions presented in
\cite{abdelgalil2023lie}, we propose a novel class of universal hybrid feedback
laws that achieve robust global practical stability by identifying the minimum
point of a set of appropriately chosen synergistic Lyapunov functions. As
concrete applications of our results, we synthesize different hybrid
high-frequency high-amplitude feedback laws for the solution of robust global
stabilization problems on various types of manifolds under unknown control
directions, as well as controllers for obstacle avoidance problems in vehicles
characterized by kinematic models describing both holonomic and non-holonomic
models. By leveraging Lie-bracket averaging for hybrid systems, we also show
how the proposed hybrid minimum-seeking feedback laws can overcome lack of
controllability during persistent (bounded) periods of time. Numerical
simulation results are presented to illustrate the main results.

homogeneous neural networks assumed to have locally Lipschitz gradients and an
order of homogeneity strictly greater than two. It is shown here that for
sufficiently small initializations, during the early stages of training, the
weights of the neural network remain small in (Euclidean) norm and
approximately converge in direction to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points of
the recently introduced neural correlation function. Additionally, this paper
also studies the KKT points of the neural correlation function for feed-forward
networks with (Leaky) ReLU and polynomial (Leaky) ReLU activations, deriving
necessary and sufficient conditions for rank-one KKT points.

orthogonal constraints. Conventional algorithms for this setting require either
manifold retractions or other types of projection to ensure feasibility, both
of which involve costly linear algebra operations (e.g., SVD or matrix
inversion). On the other hand, infeasible methods are able to provide similar
performance with higher computational efficiency. Inspired by this, we propose
the first decentralized version of the retraction-free landing algorithm,
called \textbf{D}ecentralized \textbf{R}etraction-\textbf{F}ree
\textbf{G}radient \textbf{T}racking (DRFGT). We theoretically prove that DRFGT
enjoys the ergodic convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$, matching the
convergence rate of centralized, retraction-based methods. We further establish
that under a local Riemannian P{\L} condition, DRFGT achieves a much faster
linear convergence rate. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DRFGT performs
on par with the state-of-the-art retraction-based methods with substantially
reduced computational overhead.

method of multipliers (pADMM), whose proximal terms are convex quadratic
functions, for solving linearly constrained convex optimization problems. To
achieve this, we first reformulate the pADMM into a form of proximal point
method (PPM) with a positive semidefinite preconditioner which can be
degenerate due to the lack of strong convexity of the proximal terms in the
pADMM. Then we accelerate the pADMM by accelerating the reformulated degenerate
PPM (dPPM). Specifically, we first propose an accelerated dPPM by integrating
the Halpern iteration and the fast Krasnosel'ski\u{i}-Mann iteration into it,
achieving asymptotic $o(1/k)$ and non-asymptotic $O(1/k)$ convergence rates.
Subsequently, building upon the accelerated dPPM, we develop an accelerated
pADMM algorithm that exhibits both asymptotic $o(1/k)$ and non-asymptotic
$O(1/k)$ nonergodic convergence rates concerning the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
residual and the primal objective function value gap. Preliminary numerical
experiments validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating that the
accelerated pADMM outperforms the pADMM in solving convex quadratic programming
problems.

towards the sought-after solution of the original problem. We propose a
methodology for the systematic construction of such zero curves for
discrete-time optimal control problems drawing upon the theory of globally
convergent homotopies for nonlinear programs. The proposed framework ensures
that for almost every initial guess at a solution there exists a suitable
homotopy path that is, in addition, numerically convenient to track. We
demonstrate the results by solving optimal path planning problems for a linear
system and the nonlinear nonholonomic car (Dubins' vehicle).

                                        <span>  This paper studies the complexity of finding approximate stationary points
for the smooth nonconvex-strongly-concave (NC-SC) saddle point problem:
$\min_x\max_yf(x,y)$. Under the standard first-order smoothness conditions
where $f$ is $\ell$-smooth in both arguments and $\mu_y$-strongly concave in
$y$, existing literature shows that the optimal complexity for first-order
methods to obtain an $\epsilon$-stationary point is
$\tilde{O}\big(\sqrt{\kappa_y}\ell\epsilon^{-2}\big)$, where
$\kappa_y=\ell/\mu_y$ is the condition number. However, when $\Phi(x):=\max_y
f(x,y)$ has $L_2$-Lipschitz continuous Hessian in addition, we derive a
first-order algorithm with an
$\tilde{O}\big(\sqrt{\kappa_y}\ell^{1/2}L_2^{1/4}\epsilon^{-7/4}\big)$
complexity by designing an accelerated proximal point algorithm enhanced with
the "Convex Until Proven Guilty" technique. Moreover, an improved
$\Omega\big(\sqrt{\kappa_y}\ell^{3/7}L_2^{2/7}\epsilon^{-12/7}\big)$ lower
bound for first-order method is also derived for sufficiently small $\epsilon$.
As a result, given the second-order smoothness of the problem, the complexity
of our method improves the state-of-the-art result by a factor of
$\tilde{O}\big(\big(\frac{\ell^2}{L_2\epsilon}\big)^{1/4}\big)$, while almost
matching the lower bound except for a small
$\tilde{O}\big(\big(\frac{\ell^2}{L_2\epsilon}\big)^{1/28}\big)$ factor.

                                        <span>  While imitation learning (IL) offers a promising framework for teaching
robots various behaviors, learning complex tasks remains challenging. Existing
IL policies struggle to generalize effectively across visual and spatial
variations even for simple tasks. In this work, we introduce SPHINX: Salient
Point-based Hybrid ImitatioN and eXecution, a flexible IL policy that leverages
multimodal observations (point clouds and wrist images), along with a hybrid
action space of low-frequency, sparse waypoints and high-frequency, dense end
effector movements. Given 3D point cloud observations, SPHINX learns to infer
task-relevant points within a point cloud, or salient points, which support
spatial generalization by focusing on semantically meaningful features. These
salient points serve as anchor points to predict waypoints for long-range
movement, such as reaching target poses in free-space. Once near a salient
point, SPHINX learns to switch to predicting dense end-effector movements given
close-up wrist images for precise phases of a task. By exploiting the strengths
of different input modalities and action representations for different
manipulation phases, SPHINX tackles complex tasks in a sample-efficient,
generalizable manner. Our method achieves 86.7% success across 4 real-world and
2 simulated tasks, outperforming the next best state-of-the-art IL baseline by
41.1% on average across 440 real world trials. SPHINX additionally generalizes
to novel viewpoints, visual distractors, spatial arrangements, and execution
speeds with a 1.7x speedup over the most competitive baseline. Our website
(http://sphinx-manip.github.io) provides open-sourced code for data collection,
training, and evaluation, along with supplementary videos.

task performance. However, achieving optimal performance requires that the
robot's level of assistance adjusts the operator's cognitive workload in
response to the task difficulty. Understanding and dynamically adjusting this
balance is crucial to maximizing efficiency and user satisfaction. In this
paper, we propose a novel benchmarking method for shared control systems based
on Fitts' Law to formally parameterize the difficulty level of a
target-reaching task. With this we systematically quantify and model the effect
of task difficulty (i.e. size and distance of target) and robot autonomy on
task performance and operators' cognitive load and trust levels. Our empirical
results (N=24) not only show that both task difficulty and robot autonomy
influence task performance, but also that the performance can be modelled using
these parameters, which may allow for the generalization of this relationship
across more diverse setups. We also found that the users' perceived cognitive
load and trust were influenced by these factors. Given the challenges in
directly measuring cognitive load in real-time, our adapted Fitts' model
presents a potential alternative approach to estimate cognitive load through
determining the difficulty level of the task, with the assumption that greater
task difficulty results in higher cognitive load levels. We hope that these
insights and our proposed framework inspire future works to further investigate
the generalizability of the method, ultimately enabling the benchmarking and
systematic assessment of shared control quality and user impact, which will aid
in the development of more effective and adaptable systems.

servers for performance and ease of management. However, cloud compute can be
costly, cloud services can suffer occasional downtime, and connectivity between
the robot and cloud can be prone to variations in network Quality-of-Service
(QoS). We present FogROS2-FT (Fault Tolerant) to mitigate these issues by
introducing a multi-cloud extension that automatically replicates independent
stateless robotic services, routes requests to these replicas, and directs the
first response back. With replication, robots can still benefit from cloud
computations even when a cloud service provider is down or there is low QoS.
Additionally, many cloud computing providers offer low-cost spot computing
instances that may shutdown unpredictably. Normally, these low-cost instances
would be inappropriate for cloud robotics, but the fault tolerance nature of
FogROS2-FT allows them to be used reliably. We demonstrate FogROS2-FT fault
tolerance capabilities in 3 cloud-robotics scenarios in simulation (visual
object detection, semantic segmentation, motion planning) and 1 physical robot
experiment (scan-pick-and-place). Running on the same hardware specification,
FogROS2-FT achieves motion planning with up to 2.2x cost reduction and up to a
5.53x reduction on 99 Percentile (P99) long-tail latency. FogROS2-FT reduces
the P99 long-tail latency of object detection and semantic segmentation by 2.0x
and 2.1x, respectively, under network slowdown and resource contention.

generalization of spatial, functional, and dynamic information from one object
to an unseen counterpart. Compared to shape correspondence, semantic
correspondence is more effective in generalizing across different object
categories. To this end, we present DenseMatcher, a method capable of computing
3D correspondences between in-the-wild objects that share similar structures.
DenseMatcher first computes vertex features by projecting multiview 2D features
onto meshes and refining them with a 3D network, and subsequently finds dense
correspondences with the obtained features using functional map. In addition,
we craft the first 3D matching dataset that contains colored object meshes
across diverse categories. In our experiments, we show that DenseMatcher
significantly outperforms prior 3D matching baselines by 43.5%. We demonstrate
the downstream effectiveness of DenseMatcher in (i) robotic manipulation, where
it achieves cross-instance and cross-category generalization on long-horizon
complex manipulation tasks from observing only one demo; (ii) zero-shot color
mapping between digital assets, where appearance can be transferred between
different objects with relatable geometry.

                                        <span>  Surgical interventions, particularly in neurology, represent complex and
high-stakes scenarios that impose substantial cognitive burdens on surgical
teams. Although deliberate education and practice can enhance cognitive
capabilities, surgical training opportunities remain limited due to patient
safety concerns. To address these cognitive challenges in surgical training and
operation, we propose SurgBox, an agent-driven sandbox framework to
systematically enhance the cognitive capabilities of surgeons in immersive
surgical simulations. Specifically, our SurgBox leverages large language models
(LLMs) with tailored Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to authentically
replicate various surgical roles, enabling realistic training environments for
deliberate practice. In particular, we devise Surgery Copilot, an AI-driven
assistant to actively coordinate the surgical information stream and support
clinical decision-making, thereby diminishing the cognitive workload of
surgical teams during surgery. By incorporating a novel Long-Short Memory
mechanism, our Surgery Copilot can effectively balance immediate procedural
assistance with comprehensive surgical knowledge. Extensive experiments using
real neurosurgical procedure records validate our SurgBox framework in both
enhancing surgical cognitive capabilities and supporting clinical
decision-making. By providing an integrated solution for training and
operational support to address cognitive challenges, our SurgBox framework
advances surgical education and practice, potentially transforming surgical
outcomes and healthcare quality. The code is available at

hand interactions with articulated objects. Unlike prior works, we do not rely
on a reference grasp, a coarse hand trajectory, or separate modes for grasping
and articulating. To achieve this, we first generate distance-based contact
maps conditioned on the object trajectory with an articulation-aware feature
representation, revealing rich bimanual patterns for manipulation. The learned
contact prior is then used to guide our hand motion generator, producing
diverse and realistic bimanual motions for object movement and articulation.
Our work offers key insights into feature representation and contact prior for
articulated objects, demonstrating their effectiveness in taming the complex,
high-dimensional space of bimanual hand-object interactions. Through
comprehensive quantitative experiments, we demonstrate a clear step towards
simplified and high-quality hand-object animations that excel over the
state-of-the-art in motion quality and diversity.

warning (FCW) functionality, which is key to all Automatic Emergency Braking
(AEB) systems. Although the success of solutions using frame-based cameras
(e.g., Mobileye's solutions) has been witnessed in normal situations, some
extreme cases, such as the sudden variation in the relative speed of leading
vehicles and the sudden appearance of pedestrians, still pose significant risks
that cannot be handled. This is due to the inherent imaging principles of
frame-based cameras, where the time interval between adjacent exposures
introduces considerable system latency to AEB. Event cameras, as a novel
bio-inspired sensor, offer ultra-high temporal resolution and can
asynchronously report brightness changes at the microsecond level. To explore
the potential of event cameras in the above-mentioned challenging cases, we
propose EvTTC, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first multi-sensor
dataset focusing on TTC tasks under high-relative-speed scenarios. EvTTC
consists of data collected using standard cameras and event cameras, covering
various potential collision scenarios in daily driving and involving multiple
collision objects. Additionally, LiDAR and GNSS/INS measurements are provided
for the calculation of ground-truth TTC. Considering the high cost of testing
TTC algorithms on full-scale mobile platforms, we also provide a small-scale
TTC testbed for experimental validation and data augmentation. All the data and
the design of the testbed are open sourced, and they can serve as a benchmark
that will facilitate the development of vision-based TTC techniques.

settings. For engaging people in a natural environment a smooth social
interaction as well as acceptance by the users are important issues for future
successful Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). The type of verbal communication has
a special significance here. In this paper we investigate the effects of spoken
language varieties of a non-standard/regional language compared to standard
language. More precisely we compare a human dialog with a humanoid social robot
Pepper where the robot on the one hand is answering in High German and on the
other hand in Low German, a regional language that is understood and partly
still spoken in the northern parts of Germany. The content of what the robot
says remains the same in both variants. We are interested in the effects that
these two different ways of robot talk have on human interlocutors who are more
or less familiar with Low German in terms of perceived warmth, competence and
possible discomfort in conversation against a background of cultural identity.
To measure these factors we use the Robotic Social Attributes Scale (RoSAS) on
17 participants with an age ranging from 19 to 61. Our results show that
significantly higher warmth is perceived in the Low German version of the
conversation.

or customer care in an official environment, e.g. in municipal offices? If so,
what could such an application scenario look like and what skills would the
robot need to have when interacting with human customers? What are requirements
for this kind of interactions? We have devised an application scenario for such
a case, determined the necessary or desirable capabilities of the robot,
developed a corresponding robot application and carried out initial tests and
evaluations in a project together with the Kiel City Council. One of the most
important insights gained in the project was that a humanoid robot with natural
language processing capabilities based on large language models as well as
human-like gestures and posture changes (animations) proved to be much more
preferred by users compared to standard browser-based solutions on tablets for
an information system in the City Council. Furthermore, we propose a connection
of the ACT-R cognitive architecture with the robot, where an ACT-R model is
used in interaction with the robot application to cognitively process and
enhance a dialogue between human and robot.

                                        <span>  Robots can acquire complex manipulation skills by learning policies from
expert demonstrations, which is often known as vision-based imitation learning.
Generating policies based on diffusion and flow matching models has been shown
to be effective, particularly in robotics manipulation tasks. However,
recursion-based approaches are often inference inefficient in working from
noise distributions to policy distributions, posing a challenging trade-off
between efficiency and quality. This motivates us to propose FlowPolicy, a
novel framework for fast policy generation based on consistency flow matching
and 3D vision. Our approach refines the flow dynamics by normalizing the
self-consistency of the velocity field, enabling the model to derive task
execution policies in a single inference step. Specifically, FlowPolicy
conditions on the observed 3D point cloud, where consistency flow matching
directly defines straight-line flows from different time states to the same
action space, while simultaneously constraining their velocity values, that is,
we approximate the trajectories from noise to robot actions by normalizing the
self-consistency of the velocity field within the action space, thus improving
the inference efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of FlowPolicy on Adroit
and Metaworld, demonstrating a 7$\times$ increase in inference speed while
maintaining competitive average success rates compared to state-of-the-art
policy models. Codes will be made publicly available.

agents for reinforcement learning tasks, based on deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) networks. The samples from which the DTs are built, use the environment's
state as features and the corresponding action as label. To solve the
nontrivial task of selecting samples, which on one hand reflect the DRL agent's
capabilities of choosing the right action but on the other hand also cover
enough state space to generalize well, we developed an algorithm to iteratively
train DTs.
  In this short paper, we apply this algorithm to a real-world implementation
of a robotic task for the first time. Real-world tasks pose additional
challenges compared to simulations, such as noise and delays. The task consists
of a physical pendulum attached to a cart, which moves on a linear track. By
movements to the left and to the right, the pendulum is to be swung in the
upright position and balanced in the unstable equilibrium. Our results
demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm to real-world tasks by
generating a DT whose performance matches the performance of the DRL agent,
while consisting of fewer parameters. This research could be a starting point
for distilling DTs from DRL agents to obtain transparent, lightweight models
for real-world reinforcement learning tasks.

increasingly common, yet many of these agents cannot engage in deep
interactions with humans. Despite this, there is a noticeable shortage of
datasets that capture multimodal information from human-robot interaction
dialogues. To address this gap, we have developed a Personal Emotional Robotic
Conversational sYstem (PERCY) and recorded a novel multimodal dataset that
encompasses rich embodied interaction data. The process involved asking
participants to complete a questionnaire and gathering their profiles on ten
topics, such as hobbies and favourite music. Subsequently, we initiated
conversations between the robot and the participants, leveraging GPT-4 to
generate contextually appropriate responses based on the participant's profile
and emotional state, as determined by facial expression recognition and
sentiment analysis. Automatic and user evaluations were conducted to assess the
overall quality of the collected data. The results of both evaluations
indicated a high level of naturalness, engagement, fluency, consistency, and
relevance in the conversation, as well as the robot's ability to provide
empathetic responses. It is worth noting that the dataset is derived from
genuine interactions with the robot, involving participants who provided
personal information and conveyed actual emotions.

promise significant advancements across robotics domains. However, aligning
these policies with end-user preferences remains a challenge, particularly when
the preferences are hard to specify. While reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) has become the predominant mechanism for alignment in
non-embodied domains like large language models, it has not seen the same
success in aligning visuomotor policies due to the prohibitive amount of human
feedback required to learn visual reward functions. To address this limitation,
we propose Representation-Aligned Preference-based Learning (RAPL), an
observation-only method for learning visual rewards from significantly less
human preference feedback. Unlike traditional RLHF, RAPL focuses human feedback
on fine-tuning pre-trained vision encoders to align with the end-user's visual
representation and then constructs a dense visual reward via feature matching
in this aligned representation space. We first validate RAPL through simulation
experiments in the X-Magical benchmark and Franka Panda robotic manipulation,
demonstrating that it can learn rewards aligned with human preferences, more
efficiently uses preference data, and generalizes across robot embodiments.
Finally, our hardware experiments align pre-trained Diffusion Policies for
three object manipulation tasks. We find that RAPL can fine-tune these policies
with 5x less real human preference data, taking the first step towards
minimizing human feedback while maximizing visuomotor robot policy alignment.

control of Tendon Driven Continuum Robots (TDCRs) using Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL), with a particular focus on the Sim-to-Real transfer of control
policies. The proposed control method employs the Modified Transpose Jacobian
(MTJ) control strategy, with its parameters optimally tuned using the Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Classical model-based
controllers encounter significant challenges due to the inherent uncertainties
and nonlinear dynamics of continuum robots. In contrast, model-free control
strategies require efficient gain-tuning to handle diverse operational
scenarios. This research aims to develop a model-free controller with
performance comparable to model-based strategies by integrating an optimal
adaptive gain-tuning system. Both simulations and real-world implementations
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the
trajectory-tracking performance of continuum robots independent of initial
conditions and paths within the operational task-space, effectively
establishing a task-free controller.

                                        <span>  One key area of research in Human-Robot Interaction is solving the
human-robot correspondence problem, which asks how a robot can learn to
reproduce a human motion demonstration when the human and robot have different
dynamics and kinematic structures. Evaluating these correspondence problem
solutions often requires the use of qualitative surveys that can be time
consuming to design and administer. Additionally, qualitative survey results
vary depending on the population of survey participants. In this paper, we
propose the use of heterogeneous time-series similarity measures as a
quantitative evaluation metric for evaluating motion correspondence to
complement these qualitative surveys. To assess the suitability of these
measures, we develop a behavioral cloning-based motion correspondence model,
and evaluate it with a qualitative survey as well as quantitative measures. By
comparing the resulting similarity scores with the human survey results, we
identify Gromov Dynamic Time Warping as a promising quantitative measure for
evaluating motion correspondence.

neuromotor abnormalities in post-stroke patients. However, spasticity caused by
stroke is still assessed manually in clinical settings. The limited and
variable nature of data collected from patients has long posed a major barrier
to quantitatively modelling spasticity with robotic measurements and fully
validating robotic assessment techniques. This paper presents a simulation
framework developed to support the design and validation of elbow spasticity
models and mitigate data problems. The framework consists of a simulation
environment of robot-assisted spasticity assessment, two motion controllers for
the robot and human models, and a stretch reflex controller. Our framework
allows simulation based on synthetic data without experimental data from human
subjects. Using this framework, we replicated the constant-velocity stretch
experiment typically used in robot-assisted spasticity assessment and evaluated
four types of spasticity models. Our results show that a spasticity reflex
model incorporating feedback on both muscle fibre velocity and length more
accurately captures joint resistance characteristics during passive elbow
stretching in spastic patients than a force-dependent model. When integrated
with an appropriate spasticity model, this simulation framework has the
potential to generate extensive datasets of virtual patients for future
research on spasticity assessment.

                                        <span>  World models have emerged as promising neural simulators for autonomous
driving, with the potential to supplement scarce real-world data and enable
closed-loop evaluations. However, current research primarily evaluates these
models based on visual realism or downstream task performance, with limited
focus on fidelity to specific action instructions - a crucial property for
generating targeted simulation scenes. Although some studies address action
fidelity, their evaluations rely on closed-source mechanisms, limiting
reproducibility. To address this gap, we develop an open-access evaluation
framework, ACT-Bench, for quantifying action fidelity, along with a baseline
world model, Terra. Our benchmarking framework includes a large-scale dataset
pairing short context videos from nuScenes with corresponding future trajectory
data, which provides conditional input for generating future video frames and
enables evaluation of action fidelity for executed motions. Furthermore, Terra
is trained on multiple large-scale trajectory-annotated datasets to enhance
action fidelity. Leveraging this framework, we demonstrate that the
state-of-the-art model does not fully adhere to given instructions, while Terra
achieves improved action fidelity. All components of our benchmark framework
will be made publicly available to support future research.

objects within intricate scenes. Our proposed method reverses the traditional
approach to object placement: our planner selects contact points first and then
determines a placement pose that solicits the selected points. This is instead
of sampling poses, identifying contact points, and evaluating pose quality. Our
algorithm facilitates stability-aware object placement planning, imposing no
restrictions on object shape, convexity, or mass density homogeneity, while
avoiding combinatorial computational complexity. Our proposed stability
heuristic enables our planner to find a solution about 20 times faster when
compared to the same algorithm not making use of the heuristic and eight times
faster than a state-of-the-art method that uses the traditional
sample-and-evaluate approach. Our proposed planner is also more successful in
finding stable placements than the five other benchmarked algorithms. Derived
from first principles and validated in ten real robot experiments, our planner
offers a general and scalable method to tackle the problem of object placement
planning with rigid objects.

                                        <span>  Teleoperation is increasingly recognized as a viable solution for deploying
robots in hazardous environments. Controlling a robot to perform a complex or
demanding task may overload operators resulting in poor performance. To design
a robot controller to assist the human in executing such challenging tasks, a
comprehensive understanding of the interplay between the robot's autonomous
behavior and the operator's internal state is essential. In this paper, we
investigate the relationships between robot autonomy and both the human user's
cognitive load and trust levels, and the potential existence of three-way
interactions in the robot-assisted execution of the task. Our user study (N=24)
results indicate that while the autonomy level influences the teleoperator's
perceived cognitive load and trust, there is no clear interaction between these
factors. Instead, these elements appear to operate independently, thus
highlighting the need to consider both cognitive load and trust as distinct but
interrelated factors in varying the robot autonomy level in shared-control
settings. This insight is crucial for the development of more effective and
adaptable assistive robotic systems.

                                        <span>  The prominence of embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI), which empowers
robots to navigate, perceive, and engage within virtual environments, has
attracted significant attention, owing to the remarkable advances in computer
vision and large language models. Privacy emerges as a pivotal concern within
the realm of embodied AI, as the robot accesses substantial personal
information. However, the issue of privacy leakage in embodied AI tasks,
particularly concerning reinforcement learning algorithms, has not received
adequate consideration in research. This paper aims to address this gap by
proposing an attack on the training process of the value-based algorithm and
the gradient-based algorithm, utilizing gradient inversion to reconstruct
states, actions, and supervisory signals. The choice of using gradients for the
attack is motivated by the fact that commonly employed federated learning
techniques solely utilize gradients computed based on private user data to
optimize models, without storing or transmitting the data to public servers.
Nevertheless, these gradients contain sufficient information to potentially
expose private data. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the
AI2THOR simulator and evaluated our algorithm on active perception, a prevalent
task in embodied AI. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method in successfully reconstructing all information from the data in 120
room layouts. Check our website for videos.

                                        <span>  Achieving both target accuracy and robustness in dynamic maneuvers with long
flight phases, such as high or long jumps, has been a significant challenge for
legged robots. To address this challenge, we propose a novel learning-based
control approach consisting of model learning and model predictive control
(MPC) utilizing a variable-frequency scheme. Compared to existing MPC
techniques, we learn a model directly from experiments, accounting not only for
leg dynamics but also for modeling errors and unknown dynamics mismatch in
hardware and during contact. Additionally, learning the model with
variable-frequency allows us to cover the entire flight phase and final jumping
target, enhancing the prediction accuracy of the jumping trajectory. Using the
learned model, we also design variable-frequency to effectively leverage
different jumping phases and track the target accurately. In a total of 92
jumps on Unitree A1 robot hardware, we verify that our approach outperforms
other MPCs using fixed frequency or nominal model, reducing the jumping
distance error 2 to 8 times. We also achieve jumping distance errors of less
than 3 percent during continuous jumping on uneven terrain with randomly placed
perturbations of random heights (up to 4 cm or 27 percent the robot standing
height). Our approach obtains distance errors of 1 to 2 cm on 34 single and
continuous jumps with different jumping targets and model uncertainties. Code

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable
dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based
optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by
high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand,
reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional
spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real
gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end
pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve
robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the
Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL
policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill
outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance,
with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory
tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.

as to how cyclists will interact with such vehicles. This study investigated
(1) whether cyclists spontaneously notice if a vehicle is driverless, (2) how
well they perform a driver-detection task when explicitly instructed, and (3)
how they carry out these tasks. Using a Wizard-of-Oz method, 37 participants
cycled a designated route and encountered an AV multiple times in two
experimental sessions. In Session 1, participants cycled the route
uninstructed, while in Session 2, they were instructed to verbally report
whether they detected the presence or absence of a driver. Additionally, we
recorded participants' gaze behaviour with eye-tracking and their responses in
post-session interviews. The interviews revealed that 30% of the cyclists
spontaneously mentioned the absence of a driver (Session 1), and when
instructed (Session 2), they detected the absence and presence of the driver
with 93% accuracy. The eye-tracking data showed that cyclists looked more
frequently and for longer at the vehicle in Session 2 compared to Session 1.
Additionally, participants exhibited intermittent sampling of the vehicle, and
they looked at the area in front of the vehicle when it was far away and
towards the windshield region when it was closer. The post-session interviews
also indicated that participants were curious, but felt safe, and reported a
need to receive information about the AV's driving state. In conclusion,
cyclists can detect the absence of a driver in the AV, and this detection may
influence their perception of safety. Further research is needed to explore
these findings in real-world traffic conditions.

(3DGS) capable of 3D point-level open vocabulary understanding. Our primary
motivation stems from observing that existing 3DGS-based open vocabulary
methods mainly focus on 2D pixel-level parsing. These methods struggle with 3D
point-level tasks due to weak feature expressiveness and inaccurate 2D-3D
feature associations. To ensure robust feature presentation and 3D point-level
understanding, we first employ SAM masks without cross-frame associations to
train instance features with 3D consistency. These features exhibit both
intra-object consistency and inter-object distinction. Then, we propose a
two-stage codebook to discretize these features from coarse to fine levels. At
the coarse level, we consider the positional information of 3D points to
achieve location-based clustering, which is then refined at the fine level.
Finally, we introduce an instance-level 3D-2D feature association method that
links 3D points to 2D masks, which are further associated with 2D CLIP
features. Extensive experiments, including open vocabulary-based 3D object
selection, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object selection, and
ablation studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The

                                        <span>  Soft robots can exhibit better performance in specific tasks compared to
conventional robots, particularly in healthcare-related tasks. However, the
field of soft robotics is still young, and designing them often involves
mimicking natural organisms or relying heavily on human experts' creativity. A
formal automated design process is required. We propose the use of
neuroevolution-based algorithms to automatically design initial sketches of
soft actuators that can enable the movement of future medical devices, such as
drug-delivering catheters. The actuator morphologies discovered by algorithms
like Age-Fitness Pareto Optimization, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies
(NEAT), and Hypercube-based NEAT (HyperNEAT) were compared based on the maximum
displacement reached and their robustness against various control methods.
Analyzing the results granted the insight that neuroevolution-based algorithms
produce better-performing and more robust actuators under different control
methods. Moreover, the best-performing morphologies were discovered by the NEAT
algorithm. As a future work aspect, we propose using the morphologies
discovered here as test beds to optimize specialized controllers, enabling more
effective functionality towards the desired deflections of the suggested soft
catheters.

                                        <span>  Generalization in robotic manipulation remains a critical challenge,
particularly when scaling to new environments with limited demonstrations. This
paper introduces CAGE, a novel robotic manipulation policy designed to overcome
these generalization barriers by integrating a causal attention mechanism. CAGE
utilizes the powerful feature extraction capabilities of the vision foundation
model DINOv2, combined with LoRA fine-tuning for robust environment
understanding. The policy further employs a causal Perceiver for effective
token compression and a diffusion-based action prediction head with attention
mechanisms to enhance task-specific fine-grained conditioning. With as few as
50 demonstrations from a single training environment, CAGE achieves robust
generalization across diverse visual changes in objects, backgrounds, and
viewpoints. Extensive experiments validate that CAGE significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art RGB/RGB-D approaches in various manipulation tasks,
especially under large distribution shifts. In similar environments, CAGE
offers an average of 42% increase in task completion rate. While all baselines
fail to execute the task in unseen environments, CAGE manages to obtain a 43%
completion rate and a 51% success rate in average, making a huge step towards
practical deployment of robots in real-world settings. Project website:

                                        <span>  Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for 3D
scene representation, offering high-fidelity renderings and reconstructions
from a set of sparse and unstructured sensor data. In the context of autonomous
robotics, where perception and understanding of the environment are pivotal,
NeRF holds immense promise for improving performance. In this paper, we present
a comprehensive survey and analysis of the state-of-the-art techniques for
utilizing NeRF to enhance the capabilities of autonomous robots. We especially
focus on the perception, localization and navigation, and decision-making
modules of autonomous robots and delve into tasks crucial for autonomous
operation, including 3D reconstruction, segmentation, pose estimation,
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), navigation and planning, and
interaction. Our survey meticulously benchmarks existing NeRF-based methods,
providing insights into their strengths and limitations. Moreover, we explore
promising avenues for future research and development in this domain. Notably,
we discuss the integration of advanced techniques such as 3D Gaussian splatting
(3DGS), large language models (LLM), and generative AIs, envisioning enhanced
reconstruction efficiency, scene understanding, decision-making capabilities.
This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers seeking to leverage NeRFs to

reducing accumulated errors and achieving reliable localization. However,
existing reviews predominantly concentrate on visual place recognition (VPR)
methods. Despite the recent remarkable progress in LPR, to the best of our
knowledge, there is no dedicated systematic review in this area. This paper
bridges the gap by providing a comprehensive review of place recognition
methods employing LiDAR sensors, thus facilitating and encouraging further
research. We commence by delving into the problem formulation of place
recognition, exploring existing challenges, and describing relations to
previous surveys. Subsequently, we conduct an in-depth review of related
research, which offers detailed classifications, strengths and weaknesses, and
architectures. Finally, we summarize existing datasets, commonly used
evaluation metrics, and comprehensive evaluation results from various methods
on public datasets. This paper can serve as a valuable tutorial for newcomers
entering the field of place recognition and for researchers interested in
long-term robot localization. We pledge to maintain an up-to-date project on

human-like intelligence. Inspired by the human's cognitive ability to
selectively process and filter elements in complex environments, this paper
introduces a novel concept and scene-understanding approach termed `relevance.'
It identifies relevant components in a scene. To accurately and efficiently
quantify relevance, we developed an event-based framework that selectively
triggers relevance determination, along with a probabilistic methodology built
on a structured scene representation. Simulation results demonstrate that the
relevance framework and methodology accurately predict the relevance of a
general HRC setup, achieving a precision of 0.99 and a recall of 0.94.
Relevance can be broadly applied to several areas in HRC to improve task
planning time by 79.56% compared with pure planning for a cereal task, reduce
perception latency by up to 26.53% for an object detector, improve HRC safety
by up to 13.50% and reduce the number of inquiries for HRC by 80.84%. A
real-world demonstration showcases the relevance framework's ability to
intelligently assist humans in everyday tasks.

                                        <span>  Scaling robot learning requires data collection pipelines that scale
favorably with human effort. In this work, we propose Crowdsourcing and
Amortizing Human Effort for Real-to-Sim-to-Real(CASHER), a pipeline for scaling
up data collection and learning in simulation where the performance scales
superlinearly with human effort. The key idea is to crowdsource digital twins
of real-world scenes using 3D reconstruction and collect large-scale data in
simulation, rather than the real-world. Data collection in simulation is
initially driven by RL, bootstrapped with human demonstrations. As the training
of a generalist policy progresses across environments, its generalization
capabilities can be used to replace human effort with model generated
demonstrations. This results in a pipeline where behavioral data is collected
in simulation with continually reducing human effort. We show that CASHER
demonstrates zero-shot and few-shot scaling laws on three real-world tasks
across diverse scenarios. We show that CASHER enables fine-tuning of
pre-trained policies to a target scenario using a video scan without any
additional human effort. See our project website:

                                        <span>  In recent years, the fifth-generation (5G) mobile network has been developed
worldwide to remarkably improve network performance and spectral efficiency.
Very recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) technology has
emerged as an innovative solution for controlling the propagation medium of the
forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) networks. Specifically, RIS takes advantage
of the reflected rays on the propagation environment to redirect them to a
desired target, improving wireless coverage. To further improve RIS
performance, an interesting technique called synchronized transmission with
advanced reconfigurable surfaces (STARS) has appeared to allow simultaneous
transmission and reflection of intelligent omni-surfaces. With that in mind,
this paper introduces an enhanced strategy for the network planning of 5G and
beyond (B5G) mobile networks in dense urban scenarios focused on the city of
Quito-Ecuador. The efficacy of RIS and its cutting-edge STARS concept is
emphasized, providing useful insights into coverage, quality, and throughput
results. In particular, this work considers the 3.5/28 GHz frequency bands,
optimizing the radio network and anticipating their applicability in B5G
networks. Finally, simulation results are also shown, which allow the
identification of the benefits of STAR RIS in terms of coverage, signal
quality, and data performance.

                                        <span>  This paper is concerned with parameter identification problem for finite
impulse response (FIR) systems with binary-valued observations under low
computational complexity. Most of the existing algorithms under binary-valued
observations rely on projection operators, which leads to a high computational
complexity of much higher than O(n^2). In response, this paper introduces a
recursive projection-free identification algorithm that incorporates a
specialized cut-off coefficient to fully utilize prior information, thereby
eliminating the need for projection operators. The algorithm is proved to be
mean square and almost surely convergent. Furthermore, to better leverage prior
information, an adaptive accelerated coefficient is introduced, resulting in a
mean square convergence rate of O(1/k) , which matches the convergence rate
with accurate observations. Inspired by the structure of the Cramer-Rao lower
bound, the algorithm can be extended to an information-matrix projection-free
algorithm by designing adaptive weight coefficients. This extension is proved
to be asymptotically efficient for first-order FIR systems, with simulations
indicating similar results for high order FIR systems. Finally, numerical
examples are provided to demonstrate the main results.

                                        <span>  We consider finite-dimensional many-body quantum systems described by
time-independent Hamiltonians and Markovian master equations, and present a
systematic method for constructing smaller-dimensional, reduced models that
exactly reproduce the time evolution of a set of initial conditions or
observables of interest. Our approach exploits Krylov operator spaces and their
extension to operator algebras, and may be used to obtain reduced linear models
of minimal dimension, well-suited for simulation on classical computers, or
reduced quantum models that preserve the structural constraints of physically
admissible quantum dynamics, as required for simulation on quantum computers.
Notably, we prove that the reduced quantum-dynamical generator is still in
Lindblad form. By introducing a new type of observable-dependent symmetries, we
show that our method provides a non-trivial generalization of techniques that
leverage symmetries, unlocking new reduction opportunities. We quantitatively
benchmark our method on paradigmatic open many-body systems of relevance to
condensed-matter and quantum-information physics. In particular, we demonstrate
how our reduced models can quantitatively describe decoherence dynamics in
central-spin systems coupled to structured environments, magnetization
transport in boundary-driven dissipative spin chains, and unwanted error
dynamics on information encoded in a noiseless quantum code.

control of Tendon Driven Continuum Robots (TDCRs) using Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL), with a particular focus on the Sim-to-Real transfer of control
policies. The proposed control method employs the Modified Transpose Jacobian
(MTJ) control strategy, with its parameters optimally tuned using the Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Classical model-based
controllers encounter significant challenges due to the inherent uncertainties
and nonlinear dynamics of continuum robots. In contrast, model-free control
strategies require efficient gain-tuning to handle diverse operational
scenarios. This research aims to develop a model-free controller with
performance comparable to model-based strategies by integrating an optimal
adaptive gain-tuning system. Both simulations and real-world implementations
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the
trajectory-tracking performance of continuum robots independent of initial
conditions and paths within the operational task-space, effectively
establishing a task-free controller.

shared rail network without collisions, while meeting schedule constraints.
This problem is notoriously difficult, even more in the case of uncertain or
even unknown train speeds. We propose here a modeling and verification approach
for railway scheduling in the presence of uncertain speeds, encoded here as
uncertain segment durations. We formalize the system and propose a formal
translation to parametric timed automata. As a proof of concept, we apply our
approach to benchmarks, for which we synthesize using IMITATOR suitable
valuations for the segment durations.

                                        <span>  Suboptimal methods in optimal control arise due to a limited computational
budget, unknown system dynamics, or a short prediction window among other
reasons. Although these methods are ubiquitous, their transient performance
remains relatively unstudied. We consider the control of discrete-time,
nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and establish sufficient conditions to
analyze the finite-time closed-loop performance of such methods in terms of the
additional cost incurred due to suboptimality. Finite-time guarantees allow the
control design to distribute a limited computational budget over a time horizon
and estimate the on-the-go loss in performance due to suboptimality. We study
exponential incremental input-to-state stabilizing policies and show that for
nonlinear systems, under some mild conditions, this property is directly
implied by exponential stability without further assumptions on global
smoothness. The analysis is showcased on a suboptimal model predictive control
use case.

approximation for the Time Shift Governor (TSG), which is an add-on scheme to
the nominal closed-loop system used to enforce constraints by time-shifting the
reference trajectory in spacecraft rendezvous applications. We incorporate
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), an emerging architecture in the AI
community, as a fundamental component of CINN and propose a
Constrained-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CIKAN)-based approximation for
TSG. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the CIKAN-based TSG through
simulations of constrained spacecraft rendezvous missions on highly elliptic
orbits and present comparisons between CIKANs, MLP-based CINNs, and the
conventional TSG.

                                        <span>  In this work, we propose a framework for adapting the controller's parameters
based on learning optimal solutions from contextual black-box optimization
problems. We consider a class of control design problems for dynamical systems
operating in different environments or conditions represented by contextual
parameters. The overarching goal is to identify the controller parameters that
maximize the controlled system's performance, given different realizations of
the contextual parameters.We formulate a contextual Bayesian optimization
problem in which the solution is actively learned using Gaussian processes to
approximate the controller adaptation strategy. We demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed framework with a sim-to-real example. We learn the optimal
weighting strategy of a model predictive control for connected and automated
vehicles interacting with human-driven vehicles from simulations and then
deploy it in a real-time experiment.

                                        <span>  In agricultural settings, the unstructured nature of certain production
environments, along with the high complexity and inherent risks of production
tasks, poses significant challenges to achieving full automation and effective
on-site machine control. Remote control technology, which leverages human
intelligence and precise machine movements, ensures operator safety and boosts
productivity. Recently, virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in remote
control applications by overcoming single-view limitations and providing
three-dimensional information, yet most studies have not focused on
agricultural settings. Therefore, to bridge the gap, this study proposes a
large-scale digital mapping and immersive human-machine teleoperation framework
specifically designed for precision agriculture. In this research, a DJI
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was utilized for data collection, and a novel
video segmentation approach based on feature points was introduced. To
accommodate the variability of complex textures, this method proposes an
enhanced Structure from Motion (SfM) approach. It integrates the open Multiple
View Geometry (OpenMVG) framework with Local Features from Transformers
(LoFTR). The enhanced SfM produces a point cloud map, which is further
processed through Multi-View Stereo (MVS) to generate a complete map model. For
control, a closed-loop system utilizing TCP/IP for VR control and positioning
of agricultural machinery was introduced. This system offers a fully
visual-based method for immersive control, allowing operators to utilize VR
technology for remote operations. The experimental results demonstrate that the
user-friendly remote control method also showcases its advantages over
traditional video streaming-based remote operations, providing operators with a
more comprehensive and immersive experience and a higher level of situational
awareness.

                                        <span>  Fluid dynamics plays a crucial role in various multiphysics applications,
including energy systems, electronics cooling, and biomedical engineering.
Developing models for complex coupled systems can be challenging and
time-consuming. In particular, ensuring the consistent integration of models
from diverse physical domains requires meticulous attention. Considering the
example of (electro-)magneto hydrodynamics (on a fixed spatial domain and with
linear polarization and magnetization), this article demonstrates how
relatively complex models can be composed from simpler parts by means of a
formal language for multiphysics modeling. The Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian
Systems (EPHS) modeling language features a simple graphical syntax for
expressing the energy-based interconnection of subsystems. This reduces
cognitive load and facilitates communication, especially in multidisciplinary
environments. As the example demonstrates, existing models can be easily
integrated as subsystems of new models. Specifically, an ideal fluid model is
used as a subsystem of a Navier-Stokes-Fourier fluid model, which in turn is
reused as a subsystem of an (electro-)magneto hydrodynamics model. The
energy-based, compositional approach simplifies understanding complex models,
and it makes it easy to encapsulate, reuse, and replace (parts of) models.
Moreover, structural properties of EPHS models guarantee fundamental properties
of thermodynamic systems, such as conservation of energy, non-negative entropy
production, and Onsager reciprocal relations.

multi-platoon CF models for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) with
flexible platoon size and communication level. Specifically, we consider
forward and backward communication methods between platoons with delays. Some
general results of linear stability are mathematically proven, and numerical
simulations are performed to illustrate the effects of platoon sizes and
communication levels, as well as to demonstrate the potential for stabilizing
human-driven vehicles (HDVs) in mixed traffic conditions. The simulation
results are consistent with theoretical analysis, and demonstrate that in the
ring road scenario, CAV platoons can stabilize certain percentage of HDVs. This
paper can provide suggestions for the design of communication system of
autonomous vehicles (AVs), and management of mixed traffic flow of CAVs and
HDVs.

flow model to take into account the look-ahead capability of connected and
autonomous vehicles (CAVs), and the mixed flow dynamics of human driven and
autonomous vehicles. The look-ahead effect of CAVs is captured by a non-local
averaged density within a certain distance (the look-ahead distance). We show,
using wave perturbation analysis, that increased look-ahead distance loosens
the stability criteria. Our numerical experiments, however, showed that a
longer look-ahead distance does not necessarily lead to faster convergence to
equilibrium states. We also examined the impact of spatial distributions and
market penetrations of CAVs and showed that increased market penetration helps
stabilizing mixed traffic while the spatial distribution of CAVs have less
effect on stability. The results revealed the potential of using CAVs to
stabilize traffic, and may provide qualitative insights on speed control in the
mixed autonomy environment.

                                        <span>  This paper presents a novel approach to coordinated vehicle platooning, where
the platoon followers communicate solely with the platoon leader. A dynamic
model is proposed to account for driving safety under communication delays.
General linear stability results are mathematically proven, and numerical
simulations are performed to analyze the impact of model parameters in two
scenarios: a ring road with initial disturbance and an infinite road with
periodic disturbance. The simulation outcomes align with the theoretical
analysis, demonstrating that the proposed "look-to-the-leader" platooning
strategy significantly outperforms conventional car-following strategies, such
as following one or two vehicles ahead, in terms of traffic flow stabilization.
This paper introduces a new perspective on organizing platoons for autonomous
vehicles, with implications for enhancing traffic stability.

                                        <span>  Lane change decision-making is a complex task due to intricate
vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-infrastructure interactions. Existing algorithms
for lane-change control often depend on vehicles with a certain level of
autonomy (e.g., autonomous or connected autonomous vehicles). To address the
challenges posed by low penetration rates of autonomous vehicles and the high
costs of precise data collection, this study proposes a dynamic lane change
regulation design based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance
freeway traffic efficiency. The proposed framework leverages multi-lane
macroscopic traffic models that describe spatial-temporal dynamics of the
density and speed for each lane. Lateral traffic flow between adjacent lanes,
resulting from aggregated lane-changing behaviors, is modeled as source terms
exchanged between the partial differential equations (PDEs). We propose a lane
change regulation strategy using MARL, where one agent is placed at each
discretized lane grid. The state of each agent is represented by aggregated
vehicle attributes within its grid, generated from the SUMO microscopic
simulation environment. The agent's actions are lane-change regulations for
vehicles in its grid. Specifically, lane-change regulation signals are computed
at a centralized traffic management center and then broadcast to connected
vehicles in the corresponding lane grids. Compared to vehicle-level maneuver
control, this approach achieves a higher regulation rate by leveraging vehicle
connectivity while introducing no critical safety concerns, and accommodating
varying levels of connectivity and autonomy within the traffic system. The
proposed model is simulated and evaluated in varied traffic scenarios and
demand conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the method improves
overall traffic efficiency with minimal additional energy consumption while
maintaining driving safety.

                                        <span>  The power packet dispatching system has been studied for power management
with strict tie to an accompanying information system through power
packetization. In the system, integrated units of transfer of power and
information, called power packets, are delivered through a network of
apparatuses called power packet routers. This paper proposes upstream
allocation of a bidirectional load demand represented by a sequence of power
packets to power sources. We first develop a scheme of power packet routing for
upstream allocation of load demand with full integration of power and
information transfer. The routing scheme is then proved to enable packetized
management of bidirectional load demand, which is of practical importance for
applicability to, e.g., electric drives in motoring and regenerating
operations. We present a way of packetizing the bidirectional load demand and
realizing the power and information flow under the upstream allocation scheme.
The viability of the proposed methods is demonstrated through experiments.

This approach can be applied to any multilevel inverter with various numbers of

                                        <span>  Risk measures, which typically evaluate the impact of extreme losses, are
highly sensitive to misspecification in the tails. This paper studies a robust
optimization approach to combat tail uncertainty by proposing a unifying
framework to construct uncertainty sets for a broad class of risk measures,
given a specified nominal model. Our framework is based on a parametrization of
robust risk measures using two (or multiple) $\phi$-divergence functions, which
enables us to provide uncertainty sets that are tailored to both the
sensitivity of each risk measure to tail losses and the tail behavior of the
nominal distribution. In addition, our formulation allows for a tractable
computation of robust risk measures, and elicitation of $\phi$-divergences that
describe a decision maker's risk and ambiguity preferences.

flow problems on random graphs. In such problems, a random nonlinear cost
functional is minimised among all flows (discrete vector-fields) with a
prescribed net flux through each vertex. On a stationary random graph embedded
in $\mathbb{R}^d$, our main result asserts that these problems converge, in the
large-scale limit, to a continuous minimisation problem where an effective cost
functional is minimised among all vector fields with prescribed divergence. Our
main result is formulated using $\Gamma$-convergence and applies to
multi-species problems. The proof employs the blow-up technique by Fonseca and
M\"uller in a discrete setting. One of the main challenges overcome is the
construction of the homogenised energy density on random graphs without a
periodic structure.

                                        <span>  We propose a novel method that solves global optimization problems in two
steps: (1) perform a (exponential) power-$N$ transformation to the
not-necessarily differentiable objective function $f$ to obtain $f_N$, and (2)
optimize the Gaussian-smoothed $f_N$ with stochastic approximations. Under mild
conditions on $f$, for any $\delta>0$, we prove that with a sufficiently large
power $N_\delta$, this method converges to a solution in the
$\delta$-neighborhood of $f$'s global maximum point. The convergence rate is
$O(d^2\sigma^4\varepsilon^{-2})$, which is faster than both the standard and
single-loop homotopy methods. Extensive experiments show that our method
requires significantly fewer iterations than other compared algorithms to
produce a high-quality solution.

                                        <span>  In this article, from the viewpoint of control theory, we discuss the
relationships among the commonly used monotonicity conditions that ensure the
well-posedness of the solutions arising from problems of mean field games
(MFGs) and mean field type control (MFTC). We first introduce the
well-posedness of general forward-backward stochastic differential equations
(FBSDEs) defined on some suitably chosen Hilbert spaces under the
$\beta$-monotonicity. We then propose a monotonicity condition for the MFG,
namely partitioning the running cost functional into two parts, so that both
parts still depend on the control and the state distribution, yet one satisfies
a strong convexity and a small mean field effect condition, while the other has
a newly introduced displacement quasi-monotonicity. To the best of our
knowledge, the latter quasi type condition has not yet been discussed in the
contemporary literature, and it can be considered as a bit more general
monotonicity condition than those commonly used. Besides, for the MFG, we show
that convexity and small mean field effect condition for the first part of
running cost functional and the quasi-monotonicity condition for the second
part together imply the $\beta$-monotonicity and thus the well-posedness for
the associated FBSDEs. For the MFTC problem, we show that the
$\beta$-monotonicity for the corresponding FBSDEs is simply the convexity
assumption on the cost functional. Finally, we consider a more general setting
where the drift functional is allowed to be non-linear for both MFG and MFTC
problems.

controllability matrix and the Gramian observability matrix, respectively.
Moreover, we establish the Kalman criteria that allows one to check easily the

                                        <span>  The Max-k-Cut problem is a fundamental combinatorial optimization challenge
that generalizes the classic NP-complete Max-Cut problem. While relaxation
techniques are commonly employed to tackle Max-k-Cut, they often lack
guarantees of equivalence between the solutions of the original problem and its
relaxation. To address this issue, we introduce the Relax-Optimize-and-Sample
(ROS) framework. In particular, we begin by relaxing the discrete constraints
to the continuous probability simplex form. Next, we pre-train and fine-tune a
graph neural network model to efficiently optimize the relaxed problem.
Subsequently, we propose a sampling-based construction algorithm to map the
continuous solution back to a high-quality Max-k-Cut solution. By integrating
geometric landscape analysis with statistical theory, we establish the
consistency of function values between the continuous solution and its mapped
counterpart. Extensive experimental results on random regular graphs and the
Gset benchmark demonstrate that the proposed ROS framework effectively scales
to large instances with up to 20000 nodes in just a few seconds, outperforming
state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, ROS exhibits strong generalization
capabilities across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution instances,
underscoring its effectiveness for large-scale optimization tasks.

literature. Finally, a simple case study on the optimal operation of a damaged
power transmission network illustrates its effectiveness.

subject to joint chance constraints. The controls are deterministic, but the
states are probabilistic due to random variables in the governing equation.
Joint chance constraints ensure that the random state variable meets pointwise
bounds with high probability. For linear governing PDEs and elliptically
distributed random parameters, we prove existence and uniqueness results for
almost-everywhere state bounds. Using the spherical-radial decomposition (SRD)
of the uncertain variable, we prove that when the probability is very large or
small, the resulting Monte Carlo estimator for the chance constraint
probability exhibits substantially reduced variance compared to the standard
Monte Carlo estimator. We further illustrate how the SRD can be leveraged to
efficiently compute derivatives of the probability function, and discuss
different expansions of the uncertain variable in the governing equation.
Numerical examples for linear and bilinear PDEs compare the performance of
Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo sampling methods, examining probability
estimation convergence as the number of samples increases. We also study how
the accuracy of the probabilities depends on the truncation of the random
variable expansion, and numerically illustrate the variance reduction of the
SRD.

introduce a novel technique that transforms SDP instances over $\mathbb{F}_q$

                                        <span>  This paper is concerned with the minimum-time path-planning problem for a
Dubins airplane under the influence of steady wind. The path-planning problem,
by transforming into the air-relative frame, is equivalent to finding the
minimum-time control strategy for a Dubins airplane to intercept a moving
target. In the air-relative frame, by applying Pontryagin's maximum principle,
the candidates for the minimum-time solution are categorized into a family of
four types: SC, CC, CCC, CSC, where S denotes a straight line segment and C
denotes a circular segment. Furthermore, the geometric properties for each type
are analyzed, indicating that the paths of SC and CC can be obtained by finding
the roots of a quadratic equation, while the paths of CCC and CSC are
determined by the roots of some nonlinear transcendental equations. An improved
bisection method is presented in the paper so that all the roots of the
transcendental equations can be computed within a constant time. As a
consequence, the globally optimal path can be obtained within a constant time
by comparing all the candidates of the four types. Finally, numerical examples
are presented, showing that the closed-form solutions derived in the paper can
ensure to find the globally optimal solution by comparing with existing methods
in the literature.

                                        <span>  We revisit the work of Roger Brockett on controllability of the Liouville
equation, with a particular focus on the following problem: Given a smooth
controlled dynamical system of the form $\dot{x} = f(x,u)$ and a state-space
diffeomorphism $\psi$, design a feedback control $u(t,x)$ to steer an arbitrary
initial state $x_0$ to $\psi(x_0)$ in finite time. This formulation of the
problem makes contact with the theory of optimal transportation and with
nonlinear controllability. For controllable linear systems, Brockett showed
that this is possible under a fairly restrictive condition on $\psi$. We prove
that controllability suffices for a much larger class of diffeomorphisms. For
nonlinear systems defined on smooth manifolds, we review a recent result of
Agrachev and Caponigro regarding controllability on the group of
diffeomorphisms. A corollary of this result states that, for control-affine
systems satisfying a bracket generating condition, any $\psi$ in a neighborhood
of the identity can be implemented using a time-varying feedback control law
that switches between finitely many time-invariant flows. We prove a
quantitative version which allows us to describe the implementation complexity
of the Agrachev-Caponigro construction in terms of a lower bound on the number
of switchings.

                                        <span>  We consider the problem of maximizing the expected average reward obtained
over an infinite time horizon by $n$ weakly coupled Markov decision processes.
Our setup is a substantial generalization of the multi-armed restless bandit
problem that allows for multiple actions and constraints. We establish a
connection with a deterministic and continuous-variable control problem where
the objective is to maximize the average reward derived from an occupancy
measure that represents the empirical distribution of the processes when $n \to
\infty$. We show that a solution of this fluid problem can be used to construct
policies for the weakly coupled processes that achieve the maximum expected
average reward as $n \to \infty$, and we give sufficient conditions for the
existence of solutions. Under certain assumptions on the constraints, we prove
that these conditions are automatically satisfied if the unconstrained
single-process problem admits a suitable unichain and aperiodic policy. In
particular, the assumptions include multi-armed restless bandits and a broad
class of problems with multiple actions and inequality constraints. Also, the
policies can be constructed in an explicit way in these cases. Our theoretical
results are complemented by several concrete examples and numerical
experiments, which include multichain setups that are covered by the
theoretical results.

of finding the largest integer that cannot be represented as a nonnegative
integral combination of given relatively prime (strictly) positive integers
(known as the Frobenius number). The main contribution of this paper are
observations regarding a previously known upper bound on the Frobenius number
where, in particular, we observe that a previously presented argument features
a subtle error, which alters the value of the upper bound. Despite this, we
demonstrate that the subtle error does not impact upon on the validity of the
upper bound, although it does impact on the upper bounds tightness. Notably, we
formally state the corrected result and additionally compare the relative
tightness of the corrected upper bound with the original. In particular, we
show that the updated bound is tighter in all but only a relatively "small"
number of cases using both formal techniques and via Monte Carlo simulation
techniques.

                                        <span>  In this manuscript, we study the stability of the origin for the multivariate
geometric Brownian motion. More precisely, under suitable sufficient
conditions, we construct a Lyapunov function such that the origin of the
multivariate geometric Brownian motion is globally asymptotically stable in
probability. Moreover, we show that such conditions can be rewritten as a
Bilinear Matrix Inequality (BMI) feasibility problem. We stress that no
commutativity relations between the drift matrix and the noise dispersion
matrices are assumed and therefore the so-called Magnus representation of the
solution of the multivariate geometric Brownian motion is complicated. In
addition, we exemplify our method in numerous specific models from the
literature such as random linear oscillators, satellite dynamics, inertia
systems, diagonal and non-diagonal noise systems, cancer self-remission and
smoking.

algorithm (TOS-SPDHG) for solving a class of convex three-composite

extension of the SPDHG algorithm [Chambolle et al. 2018]. We provide
theoretical convergence analysis showing ergodic $O(1/K)$ convergence rate, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in imaging inverse problems.
Moreover, we further propose TOS-SPDHG-RED and TOS-SPDHG-eRED which utilizes
the regularization-by-denoising (RED) framework to leverage pretrained deep
denoising networks as priors.

                                        <span>  In this study, we consider a class of linear matroid interdiction problems,
where the feasible sets for the upper-level decision-maker (referred to as a
leader) and the lower-level decision-maker (referred to as a follower) are
induced by two distinct partition matroids with a common weighted ground set.
Unlike classical network interdiction models where the leader is subject to a
single budget constraint, in our setting, both the leader and the follower are
subject to several independent capacity constraints and engage in a zero-sum
game. While the problem of finding a maximum weight independent set in a
partition matroid is known to be polynomially solvable, we prove that the
considered bilevel problem is $NP$-hard even when the weights of ground
elements are all binary. On a positive note, it is revealed that, if the number
of capacity constraints is fixed for either the leader or the follower, then
the considered class of bilevel problems admits several polynomial-time
solution schemes. Specifically, these schemes are based on a single-level dual
reformulation, a dynamic programming-based approach, and a greedy algorithm for
the leader.

                                        <span>  Deep learning optimizers are often motivated through a mix of convex and
approximate second-order theory. We select three such methods -- Adam, Shampoo
and Prodigy -- and argue that each method can instead be understood as a
squarely first-order method without convexity assumptions. In fact, after
switching off exponential moving averages, each method is equivalent to
steepest descent under a particular norm. By generalizing this observation, we
chart a new design space for training algorithms. Different operator norms
should be assigned to different tensors based on the role that the tensor plays
within the network. For example, while linear and embedding layers may have the
same weight space of $\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, these layers play different
roles and should be assigned different norms. We hope that this idea of
carefully metrizing the neural architecture might lead to more stable, scalable
and indeed faster training.

                                        <span>  For the numerical solution of shape optimization problems, particularly those
constrained by partial differential equations (PDEs), the quality of the
underlying mesh is of utmost importance. Particularly when investigating
complex geometries, the mesh quality tends to deteriorate over the course of a
shape optimization so that either the optimization comes to a halt or an
expensive remeshing operation must be performed before the optimization can be
continued. In this paper, we present a novel, semi-discrete approach for
enforcing a minimum mesh quality in shape optimization. Our approach is based
on Rosen's gradient projection method, which incorporates mesh quality
constraints into the shape optimization problem. The proposed constraints bound
the angles of triangular and solid angles of tetrahedral mesh cells and, thus,
also bound the quality of these mesh cells. The method treats these constraints
by projecting the search direction to the linear subspace of the currently
active constraints. Additionally, only slight modifications to the usual line
search procedure are required to ensure the feasibility of the method. We
present our method for two- and three-dimensional simplicial meshes. We
investigate the proposed approach numerically for the drag minimization of an
obstacle in a two-dimensional flow and for the large-scale, three-dimensional
optimization of a structured packing used in a distillation column. Our results
show that the proposed method is indeed capable of guaranteeing a minimum mesh
quality for both academic examples and challenging industrial applications.
Particularly, our approach allows the shape optimization of extremely complex
structures while ensuring that the mesh quality does not deteriorate.

epidemic. The model integrates a constant delay representing an
incubation/latency time. The control inputs model non-pharmaceutical
interventions, while an intensive care unit (ICU) state-constraint is
introduced to reflect the healthcare system's capacity. The arising delayed
control system is analyzed via functional viability tools, providing insights
into fulfilling the ICU constraint through feedback control maps. In
particular, we consider two scenarios: first, we consider the case of general
continuous initial conditions. Then, as a further refinement of our analysis,
we assume that the initial conditions satisfy a Lipschitz continuity property,
consistent with the considered model. The study compares the (in general,
sub-optimal) obtained control policies with the optimal ones for the delay-free
case, emphasizing the impact of the delay parameter. The obtained results are
supported and illustrated, in a concluding section, by numerical examples.

                                        <span>  The Koopman operator framework provides a perspective that non-linear
dynamics can be described through the lens of linear operators acting on
function spaces. As the framework naturally yields linear embedding models,
there have been extensive efforts to utilize it for control, where linear
controller designs can be applied to control possibly nonlinear dynamics.
However, it is challenging to successfully deploy this modeling procedure in a
wide range of applications. In this work, some of the fundamental limitations
of linear embedding models are addressed. We show a necessary condition for a
linear embedding model to achieve zero modeling error, highlighting a trade-off
relation between the model expressivity and a restriction on the model
structure to allow the use of linear systems theories for nonlinear dynamics.
To achieve good performance despite this trade-off, neural network-based
modeling is proposed based on linear embedding with oblique projection, which
is derived from a weak formulation of projection-based linear operator
learning. We train the proposed model using a two-stage learning procedure,
wherein the features and operators are initialized with orthogonal projection,
followed by the main training process in which test functions characterizing
the oblique projection are learned from data. The first stage achieves an
optimality ensured by the orthogonal projection and the second stage improves
the generalizability to various tasks by optimizing the model with the oblique
projection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over other
data-driven modeling methods by providing comprehensive numerical evaluations
where four tasks are considered targeting three different systems.

agents collaborate to solve problems involving nested optimization structures
with neighborhood communications. Most existing literature primarily utilizes
gradient tracking to mitigate the influence of data heterogeneity, without
exploring other well-known heterogeneity-correction techniques such as EXTRA or
Exact Diffusion. Additionally, these studies often employ identical
decentralized strategies for both upper- and lower-level problems, neglecting
to leverage distinct mechanisms across different levels. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes SPARKLE, a unified Single-loop Primal-dual
AlgoRithm frameworK for decentraLized bilEvel optimization. SPARKLE offers the
flexibility to incorporate various heterogeneitycorrection strategies into the
algorithm. Moreover, SPARKLE allows for different strategies to solve upper-
and lower-level problems. We present a unified convergence analysis for
SPARKLE, applicable to all its variants, with state-of-the-art convergence
rates compared to existing decentralized bilevel algorithms. Our results
further reveal that EXTRA and Exact Diffusion are more suitable for
decentralized bilevel optimization, and using mixed strategies in bilevel
algorithms brings more benefits than relying solely on gradient tracking.

complexity and algorithmic theory, serving as a key benchmark for understanding
computational classes. In this paper, we solve the $k$-sparse parity problem
with sign stochastic gradient descent, a variant of stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) on two-layer fully-connected neural networks. We demonstrate that this
approach can efficiently solve the $k$-sparse parity problem on a
$d$-dimensional hypercube ($k\leq O(\sqrt{d})$) with a sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}(d^{k-1})$ using $2^{\Theta(k)}$ neurons, matching the established
$\Omega(d^{k})$ lower bounds of Statistical Query (SQ) models. Our theoretical
analysis begins by constructing a good neural network capable of correctly
solving the $k$-parity problem. We then demonstrate how a trained neural
network with sign SGD can effectively approximate this good network, solving
the $k$-parity problem with small statistical errors. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first result that matches the SQ lower bound for solving
$k$-sparse parity problem using gradient-based methods.

                                        <span>  Decentralized optimization over time-varying graphs has been increasingly
common in modern machine learning with massive data stored on millions of
mobile devices, such as in federated learning. This paper revisits the widely
used accelerated gradient tracking and extends it to time-varying graphs. We
prove that the practical single loop accelerated gradient tracking needs
$O((\frac{\gamma}{1-\sigma_{\gamma}})^2\sqrt{\frac{L}{\epsilon}})$ and
$O((\frac{\gamma}{1-\sigma_{\gamma}})^{1.5}\sqrt{\frac{L}{\mu}}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$
iterations to reach an $\epsilon$-optimal solution over time-varying graphs
when the problems are nonstrongly convex and strongly convex, respectively,
where $\gamma$ and $\sigma_{\gamma}$ are two common constants charactering the
network connectivity, $L$ and $\mu$ are the smoothness and strong convexity
constants, respectively, and one iteration corresponds to one gradient oracle
call and one communication round. Our convergence rates improve significantly
over the ones of $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{5/7}})$ and
$O((\frac{L}{\mu})^{5/7}\frac{1}{(1-\sigma)^{1.5}}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$,
respectively, which were proved in the original literature of accelerated
gradient tracking only for static graphs, where
$\frac{\gamma}{1-\sigma_{\gamma}}$ equals $\frac{1}{1-\sigma}$ when the network
is time-invariant. When combining with a multiple consensus subroutine, the
dependence on the network connectivity constants can be further improved to
$O(1)$ and $O(\frac{\gamma}{1-\sigma_{\gamma}})$ for the gradient oracle and
communication round complexities, respectively. When the network is static, by
employing the Chebyshev acceleration, our complexities exactly match the lower
bounds without hiding any poly-logarithmic factor for both nonstrongly convex
and strongly convex problems.

                                        <span>  Automatic detection and prevention of open-set failures are crucial in
closed-loop robotic systems. Recent studies often struggle to simultaneously
identify unexpected failures reactively after they occur and prevent
foreseeable ones proactively. To this end, we propose Code-as-Monitor (CaM), a
novel paradigm leveraging the vision-language model (VLM) for both open-set
reactive and proactive failure detection. The core of our method is to
formulate both tasks as a unified set of spatio-temporal constraint
satisfaction problems and use VLM-generated code to evaluate them for real-time
monitoring. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring, we further
introduce constraint elements that abstract constraint-related entities or
their parts into compact geometric elements. This approach offers greater
generality, simplifies tracking, and facilitates constraint-aware visual
programming by leveraging these elements as visual prompts. Experiments show
that CaM achieves a 28.7% higher success rate and reduces execution time by
31.8% under severe disturbances compared to baselines across three simulators
and a real-world setting. Moreover, CaM can be integrated with open-loop
control policies to form closed-loop systems, enabling long-horizon tasks in
cluttered scenes with dynamic environments.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes to solve the problem of Vision-and-Language Navigation
with legged robots, which not only provides a flexible way for humans to
command but also allows the robot to navigate through more challenging and
cluttered scenes. However, it is non-trivial to translate human language
instructions all the way to low-level leg joint actions. We propose NaVILA, a
2-level framework that unifies a Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) with
locomotion skills. Instead of directly predicting low-level actions from VLA,
NaVILA first generates mid-level actions with spatial information in the form
of language, (e.g., "moving forward 75cm"), which serves as an input for a
visual locomotion RL policy for execution. NaVILA substantially improves
previous approaches on existing benchmarks. The same advantages are
demonstrated in our newly developed benchmarks with IsaacLab, featuring more
realistic scenes, low-level controls, and real-world robot experiments. We show

                                        <span>  Recent developments in Large Language Models pre-trained on extensive corpora
have shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks
with minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which
has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask:
given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge
available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be
effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify
an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot
manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through
observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning
should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level
actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions
to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video
content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer,
learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner.
We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to
capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT
demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion
tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory
rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to
real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly
bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive
experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and
efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in
transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.

textual descriptions, which is essential for applications like augmented
reality and robotics. Traditional 3DVG approaches rely on annotated 3D datasets
and predefined object categories, limiting scalability and adaptability. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce SeeGround, a zero-shot 3DVG framework
leveraging 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on large-scale 2D data. We
propose to represent 3D scenes as a hybrid of query-aligned rendered images and
spatially enriched text descriptions, bridging the gap between 3D data and
2D-VLMs input formats. We propose two modules: the Perspective Adaptation
Module, which dynamically selects viewpoints for query-relevant image
rendering, and the Fusion Alignment Module, which integrates 2D images with 3D
spatial descriptions to enhance object localization. Extensive experiments on
ScanRefer and Nr3D demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing zero-shot
methods by large margins. Notably, we exceed weakly supervised methods and
rival some fully supervised ones, outperforming previous SOTA by 7.7% on
ScanRefer and 7.1% on Nr3D, showcasing its effectiveness.

both in-distribution scenarios seen during training as well as novel

with a joint training pipeline that combines the goals of in-distribution
adaptation and out-of-distribution robustness. Our algorithm GRAM achieves
strong generalization performance across in-distribution and

variety of realistic simulated locomotion tasks with a quadruped robot.

provides real-time positional feedback. However, existing VINS and SLAM systems
cannot be directly integrated into the robot's control loop. Although VINS
offers high-frequency position estimates, it suffers from drift in long-term
operation. And the drift-free trajectory output by SLAM is post-processed with
loop correction, which is non-causal. In practical control, it is impossible to
update the current pose with future information. Furthermore, existing SLAM
evaluation systems measure accuracy after aligning the entire trajectory, which
overlooks the transformation error between the odometry start frame and the
ground truth frame. To address these issues, we propose a multi-cam multi-map
visual inertial localization system, which provides real-time, causal and
drift-free position feedback to the robot control loop. Additionally, we
analyze the error composition of map-based localization systems and propose a
set of evaluation metric suitable for measuring causal localization
performance. To validate our system, we design a multi-camera IMU hardware
setup and collect a long-term challenging campus dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate the higher real-time localization accuracy of the proposed system.
To foster community development, both the system and the dataset have been made

                                        <span>  We propose to learn legged robot locomotion skills by watching thousands of
wild animal videos from the internet, such as those featured in nature
documentaries. Indeed, such videos offer a rich and diverse collection of
plausible motion examples, which could inform how robots should move. To
achieve this, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Wild Animal Videos
(RLWAV), a method to ground these motions into physical robots. We first train
a video classifier on a large-scale animal video dataset to recognize actions
from RGB clips of animals in their natural habitats. We then train a
multi-skill policy to control a robot in a physics simulator, using the
classification score of a third-person camera capturing videos of the robot's
movements as a reward for reinforcement learning. Finally, we directly transfer
the learned policy to a real quadruped Solo. Remarkably, despite the extreme
gap in both domain and embodiment between animals in the wild and robots, our
approach enables the policy to learn diverse skills such as walking, jumping,
and keeping still, without relying on reference trajectories nor skill-specific
rewards.

                                        <span>  Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) deals with finding conflict-free paths for a
set of agents from an initial configuration to a given target configuration.
The Lifelong MAPF (LMAPF) problem is a well-studied online version of MAPF in
which an agent receives a new target when it reaches its current target. The
common approach for solving LMAPF is to treat it as a sequence of MAPF
problems, periodically replanning from the agents' current configurations to
their current targets. A significant drawback in this approach is that in MAPF
the agents must reach a configuration in which all agents are at their targets
simultaneously, which is needlessly restrictive for LMAPF. Techniques have been
proposed to indirectly mitigate this drawback. We describe cases where these
mitigation techniques fail. As an alternative, we propose to solve LMAPF
problems by solving a sequence of modified MAPF problems, in which the
objective is for each agent to eventually visit its target, but not necessarily
for all agents to do so simultaneously. We refer to this MAPF variant as
Transient MAPF (TMAPF) and propose several algorithms for solving it based on
existing MAPF algorithms. A limited experimental evaluation identifies some
cases where using a TMAPF algorithm instead of a MAPF algorithm with an LMAPF
framework can improve the system throughput significantly.

efficiency of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Existing methodologies typically adopt
two paradigms: decision then planning or generation then scoring. However, the
former often struggles with misalignment between decisions and planning, while
the latter encounters significant challenges in integrating short-term
operational utility with long-term tactical efficacy. To address these issues,
we introduce CALMM-Drive, a novel Confidence-Aware Large Multimodal Model (LMM)
empowered Autonomous Driving framework. Our approach employs Top-K confidence
elicitation, which facilitates the generation of multiple candidate decisions
along with their confidence levels. Furthermore, we propose a novel planning
module that integrates a diffusion model for trajectory generation and a
hierarchical refinement process to find the optimal path. This framework
enables the selection of the best plan accounting for both low-level solution
quality and high-level tactical confidence, which mitigates the risks of
one-shot decisions and overcomes the limitations induced by short-sighted
scoring mechanisms. Comprehensive evaluations in nuPlan closed-loop simulation
environments demonstrate the effectiveness of CALMM-Drive in achieving reliable
and flexible driving performance, showcasing a significant advancement in the
integration of uncertainty in LMM-empowered AVs. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

                                        <span>  One of the strategies to detect the pose and shape of unknown objects is
their geometric modeling, consisting on fitting known geometric entities.
Classical geometric modeling fits simple shapes such as spheres or cylinders,
but often those don't cover the variety of shapes that can be encountered. For
those situations, one solution is the use of superquadrics, which can adapt to
a wider variety of shapes.
  One of the limitations of superquadrics is that they cannot model objects
with holes, such as those with handles. This work aims to fit supersurfaces of
degree four, in particular supertoroids, to objects with a single hole.
Following the results of superquadrics, simple expressions for the major and
minor radial distances are derived, which lead to the fitting of the intrinsic
and extrinsic parameters of the supertoroid. The differential geometry of the
surface is also studied as a function of these parameters. The result is a
supergeometric modeling that can be used for symmetric objects with and without
holes with a simple distance function for the fitting. The proposed algorithm
expands considerably the amount of shapes that can be targeted for geometric
modeling.

robotics applications, where it outperforms classical methods. However, the
safety aspect of RL and the transfer to the real world remain an open
challenge. A prominent field for tackling this challenge and ensuring the
safety of the agents during training and execution is safe reinforcement
learning. Safe RL can be achieved through constrained RL and safe exploration
approaches. The former learns the safety constraints over the course of
training to achieve a safe behavior by the end of training, at the cost of high
number of collisions at earlier stages of the training. The latter offers
robust safety by enforcing the safety constraints as hard constraints, which
prevents collisions but hinders the exploration of the RL agent, resulting in
lower rewards and poor performance. To overcome those drawbacks, we propose a
novel safety shield, that combines the robustness of the optimization-based
controllers with the long prediction capabilities of the RL agents, allowing
the RL agent to adaptively tune the parameters of the controller. Our approach
is able to improve the exploration of the RL agents for navigation tasks, while
minimizing the number of collisions. Experiments in simulation show that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in the reached
goals-to-collisions ratio in different challenging environments. The
goals-to-collisions ratio metrics emphasizes the importance of minimizing the
number of collisions, while learning to accomplish the task. Our approach
achieves a higher number of reached goals compared to the classic safety
shields and fewer collisions compared to constrained RL approaches. Finally, we
demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in a real-world experiment.

critical that their motion planning and control algorithms are computationally
efficient and can be reapplied online in real time, whilst providing
theoretical safety guarantees in the presence of disturbances. The satisfaction
of these objectives becomes more challenging when considering time-varying
dynamics and disturbances, which arise in real-world contexts. We develop
methods with the potential to address these issues by applying an
offline-computed safety guaranteeing controller on a physical system, to track
a virtual system that evolves through a trajectory that is replanned online,
accounting for constraints updated online. The first method we propose is
designed for general time-varying systems over a finite horizon. Our second
method overcomes the finite horizon restriction for periodic systems. We
simulate our algorithms on a case study of an autonomous underwater vehicle
subject to wave disturbances.

increased from 91% to 95%, precision from 89% to 94%, recall from 85% to 92%,
and F1-score from 87% to 93%. The number of false positives decreased from 6 to
3, and missed defects reduced from 5 to 2. These findings demonstrate that
integrating thermal and RGB imagery enhances defect detection on WTBs,
contributing to improved maintenance and reliability.

                                        <span>  Robotic grasping in densely cluttered environments is challenging due to
scarce collision-free grasp affordances. Non-prehensile actions can increase
feasible grasps in cluttered environments, but most research focuses on
single-arm rather than dual-arm manipulation. Policies from single-arm systems
fail to fully leverage the advantages of dual-arm coordination. We propose a
target-oriented hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that
learns dual-arm push-grasp synergy for grasping objects to enhance dexterous
manipulation in dense clutter. Our framework maps visual observations to
actions via a pre-trained deep learning backbone and a novel CNN-based DRL
model, trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to develop a dual-arm
push-grasp strategy. The backbone enhances feature mapping in densely cluttered
environments. A novel fuzzy-based reward function is introduced to accelerate
efficient strategy learning. Our system is developed and trained in Isaac Gym
and then tested in simulations and on a real robot. Experimental results show
that our framework effectively maps visual data to dual push-grasp motions,
enabling the dual-arm system to grasp target objects in complex environments.
Compared to other methods, our approach generates 6-DoF grasp candidates and
enables dual-arm push actions, mimicking human behavior. Results show that our
method efficiently completes tasks in densely cluttered environments.

                                        <span>  When two pedestrians approach each other on the sidewalk head-on, they
sometimes engage in an awkward interaction, both deviating to the same side
(repeatedly) to avoid a collision. This phenomenon is known as the sidewalk
salsa. Although well known, no existing model describes how this "dance"
arises. Such a model must capture the nuances of individual interactions
between pedestrians that lead to the sidewalk salsa. Therefore, it could be
helpful in the development of mobile robots that frequently participate in such
individual interactions, for example, by informing robots in their
decision-making. Here, I present a model based on the communication-enabled
interaction framework capable of reproducing the sidewalk salsa. The model
assumes pedestrians have a deterministic plan for their future movements and a
probabilistic belief about the movements of another pedestrian. Combined, the
plan and belief result in a perceived risk that pedestrians try to keep below a
personal threshold. In simulations of this model, the sidewalk salsa occurs in
a symmetrical scenario. At the same time, it shows behavior comparable to
observed real-world pedestrian behavior in scenarios with initial position
offsets or risk threshold differences. Two other scenarios provide support for
a hypothesis from previous literature stating that cultural norms, in the form
of a biased belief about on which side others will pass (i.e. deviating to the
left or right), contribute to the occurrence of the sidewalk salsa. Thereby,
the proposed model provides insight into how the sidewalk salsa arises.

                                        <span>  Reliable perception of spatial and motion information is crucial for safe
autonomous navigation. Traditional approaches typically fall into two
categories: object-centric and class-agnostic methods. While object-centric
methods often struggle with missed detections, leading to inaccuracies in
motion prediction, many class-agnostic methods focus heavily on encoder design,
often overlooking important priors like rigidity and temporal consistency,
leading to suboptimal performance, particularly with sparse LiDAR data at
distant region. To address these issues, we propose $\textbf{PriorMotion}$, a
generative framework that extracts rasterized and vectorized scene
representations to model spatio-temporal priors. Our model comprises a BEV
encoder, an Raster-Vector prior Encoder, and a Spatio-Temporal prior Generator,
improving both spatial and temporal consistency in motion prediction.
Additionally, we introduce a standardized evaluation protocol for
class-agnostic motion prediction. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that
PriorMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance, with further validation on
advanced FMCW LiDAR confirming its robustness.

intrinsic behavior of the human musculoskeletal system, promoting safe and
natural interactions and task adaptability in real-world scenarios. However,
prosthetic design often disregards compliance because of the additional
complexity, weight, and needed control channels. This paper focuses on
designing a Variable Stiffness Actuator (VSA) with weight, size, and
performance compatible with prosthetic applications, addressing its
implementation for the elbow joint. While a direct biomimetic approach suggests
adopting an Agonist-Antagonist (AA) layout to replicate the biceps and triceps
brachii with elastic actuation, this solution is not optimal to accommodate the
varied morphologies of residual limbs. Instead, we employed the AA layout to
craft an elbow prosthesis fully contained in the user's forearm, catering to
individuals with distal transhumeral amputations. Additionally, we introduce a
variant of this design where the two motors are split in the upper arm and
forearm to distribute mass and volume more evenly along the bionic limb,
enhancing comfort for patients with more proximal amputation levels. We
characterize and validate our approach, demonstrating that both architectures
meet the target requirements for an elbow prosthesis. The system attains the
desired 120{\deg} range of motion, achieves the target stiffness range of [2,
60] Nm/rad, and can actively lift up to 3 kg. Our novel design reduces weight
by up to 50% compared to existing VSAs for elbow prostheses while achieving
performance comparable to the state of the art. Case studies suggest that
passive and variable compliance could enable robust and safe interactions and
task adaptability in the real world.

execute the underwater target tracking task collaboratively. However, it's
pretty challenging to meet various prerequisites utilizing traditional control
methods. Therefore, we propose an effective two-stage learning from
demonstrations training framework, FISHER, to highlight the adaptability of
reinforcement learning (RL) methods in the multi-AUV underwater target tracking
task, while addressing its limitations such as extensive requirements for
environmental interactions and the challenges in designing reward functions.
The first stage utilizes imitation learning (IL) to realize policy improvement
and generate offline datasets. To be specific, we introduce multi-agent
discriminator-actor-critic based on improvements of the generative adversarial
IL algorithm and multi-agent IL optimization objective derived from the Nash
equilibrium condition. Then in the second stage, we develop multi-agent
independent generalized decision transformer, which analyzes the latent
representation to match the future states of high-quality samples rather than
reward function, attaining further enhanced policies capable of handling
various scenarios. Besides, we propose a simulation to simulation demonstration
generation procedure to facilitate the generation of expert demonstrations in
underwater environments, which capitalizes on traditional control methods and
can easily accomplish the domain transfer to obtain demonstrations. Extensive
simulation experiments from multiple scenarios showcase that FISHER possesses
strong stability, multi-task performance and capability of generalization.

However, challenges such as the sim-to-real gap and limited adaptability to
diverse walking conditions persist. To address these, we developed and
validated a framework to create a skeletal humanoid agent capable of adapting

The framework combines a synthetic data generator, which produces
biomechanically plausible gait kinematics from open-source biomechanics data,
and a training system that uses adversarial imitation learning to train the
agent's walking policy. We conducted comprehensive analyses comparing the
agent's kinematics, synthetic data, and the original biomechanics dataset. The
agent achieved a root mean square error of 5.24 +- 0.09 degrees at varying
speeds compared to ground-truth kinematics data, demonstrating its
adaptability. This work represents a significant step toward developing a

                                        <span>  Maritime environmental sensing requires overcoming challenges from complex
conditions such as harsh weather, platform perturbations, large dynamic
objects, and the requirement for long detection ranges. While cameras and LiDAR
are commonly used in ground vehicle navigation, their applicability in maritime
settings is limited by range constraints and hardware maintenance issues. Radar
sensors, however, offer robust long-range detection capabilities and resilience
to physical contamination from weather and saline conditions, making it a
powerful sensor for maritime navigation. Among various radar types, X-band
radar (e.g., marine radar) is widely employed for maritime vessel navigation,
providing effective long-range detection essential for situational awareness
and collision avoidance. Nevertheless, it exhibits limitations during berthing
operations where close-range object detection is critical. To address this
shortcoming, we incorporate W-band radar (e.g., Navtech imaging radar), which
excels in detecting nearby objects with a higher update rate. We present a
comprehensive maritime sensor dataset featuring multi-range detection
capabilities. This dataset integrates short-range LiDAR data, medium-range
W-band radar data, and long-range X-band radar data into a unified framework.
Additionally, it includes object labels for oceanic object detection usage,
derived from radar and stereo camera images. The dataset comprises seven
sequences collected from diverse regions with varying levels of estimation
difficulty, ranging from easy to challenging, and includes common locations
suitable for global localization tasks. This dataset serves as a valuable
resource for advancing research in place recognition, odometry estimation,
SLAM, object detection, and dynamic object elimination within maritime
environments. Dataset can be found in following link:

                                        <span>  In this paper, a learning based Model Predictive Control (MPC) using a low
dimensional residual model is proposed for autonomous driving. One of the
critical challenge in autonomous driving is the complexity of vehicle dynamics,
which impedes the formulation of accurate vehicle model. Inaccurate vehicle
model can significantly impact the performance of MPC controller. To address
this issue, this paper decomposes the nominal vehicle model into invariable and
variable elements. The accuracy of invariable component is ensured by
calibration, while the deviations in the variable elements are learned by a
low-dimensional residual model. The features of residual model are selected as
the physical variables most correlated with nominal model errors. Physical
constraints among these features are formulated to explicitly define the valid
region within the feature space. The formulated model and constraints are
incorporated into the MPC framework and validated through both simulation and
real vehicle experiments. The results indicate that the proposed method
significantly enhances the model accuracy and controller performance.

                                        <span>  Success in racing requires a unique combination of vehicle setup,
understanding of the racetrack, and human expertise. Since building and testing
many different vehicle configurations in the real world is prohibitively
expensive, high-fidelity simulation is a critical part of racecar development.
However, testing different vehicle configurations still requires expert human
input in order to evaluate their performance on different racetracks. In this
work, we present the first steps towards an autonomous test driver, trained
using deep reinforcement learning, capable of evaluating changes in vehicle
setup on racing performance while driving at the level of the best human
drivers. In addition, the autonomous driver model can be tuned to exhibit more
human-like behavioral patterns by incorporating imitation learning into the RL
training process. This extension permits the possibility of driver-specific
vehicle setup optimization.

environment for decision-making. To enhance robustness in these safety critical
applications, this paper considers a Deep Ensemble of Deep Neural Network
regressors integrated with Conformal Prediction to predict and quantify
uncertainties. In the Adaptive Cruise Control setting, the proposed method
performs state and uncertainty estimation from RGB images, informing the
downstream controller of the DNN perception uncertainties. An adaptive cruise
controller using Conformal Tube Model Predictive Control is designed to ensure
probabilistic safety. Evaluations with a high-fidelity simulator demonstrate
the algorithm's effectiveness in speed tracking and safe distance maintaining,
including in Out-Of-Distribution scenarios.

                                        <span>  Robots in densely populated real-world environments frequently encounter
constrained and cluttered situations such as passing through narrow doorways,
hallways, and corridor intersections, where conflicts over limited space result
in collisions or deadlocks among the robots. Current decentralized
state-of-the-art optimization- and neural network-based approaches (i) are
predominantly designed for general open spaces, and (ii) are overly
conservative, either guaranteeing safety, or liveness, but not both. While some
solutions rely on centralized conflict resolution, their highly invasive
trajectories make them impractical for real-world deployment. This paper
introduces LiveNet, a fully decentralized and robust neural network controller
that enables human-like yielding and passing, resulting in agile,
non-conservative, deadlock-free, and safe, navigation in congested,
conflict-prone spaces. LiveNet is minimally invasive, without requiring
inter-agent communication or cooperative behavior. The key insight behind
LiveNet is a unified CBF formulation for simultaneous safety and liveness,
which we integrate within a neural network for robustness. We evaluated LiveNet
in simulation and found that general multi-robot optimization- and
learning-based navigation methods fail to even reach the goal, and while
methods designed specially for such environments do succeed, they are 10-20
times slower, 4-5 times more invasive, and much less robust to variations in
the scenario configuration such as changes in the start states and goal states,
among others. We open-source the LiveNet code at

effective for enforcing safe behavior on complex systems. It is often easier to
synthesize CBFs for a Reduced order Model (RoM), and track the resulting safe
behavior on the Full order Model (FoM) -- yet gaps between the RoM and FoM can
result in safety violations. This paper introduces \emph{predictive CBFs} to
address this gap by leveraging rollouts of the FoM to define a predictive
robustness term added to the RoM CBF condition. Theoretically, we prove that
this guarantees safety in a layered control implementation. Practically, we
learn the predictive robustness term through massive parallel simulation with
domain randomization. We demonstrate in simulation that this yields safe FoM
behavior with minimal conservatism, and experimentally realize predictive CBFs
on a 3D hopping robot.

                                        <span>  This paper presents a novel control algorithm for robotic manipulators in
unstructured environments using proximity sensors partially distributed on the
platform. The proposed approach exploits arrays of multi zone Time-of-Flight
(ToF) sensors to generate a sparse point cloud representation of the robot
surroundings. By employing computational geometry techniques, we fuse the
knowledge of robot geometric model with ToFs sensory feedback to generate
whole-body motion tasks, allowing to move both sensorized and non-sensorized
links in response to unpredictable events such as human motion. In particular,
the proposed algorithm computes the pair of closest points between the
environment cloud and the robot links, generating a dynamic avoidance motion
that is implemented as the highest priority task in a two-level hierarchical
architecture. Such a design choice allows the robot to work safely alongside
humans even without a complete sensorization over the whole surface.
Experimental validation demonstrates the algorithm effectiveness both in static
and dynamic scenarios, achieving comparable performances with respect to well
established control techniques that aim to move the sensors mounting positions
on the robot body. The presented algorithm exploits any arbitrary point on the
robot surface to perform avoidance motion, showing improvements in the distance
margin up to 100 mm, due to the rendering of virtual avoidance tasks on
non-sensorized links.

                                        <span>  Robotic wire arc additive manufacturing has been widely adopted due to its
high deposition rates and large print volume relative to other metal additive
manufacturing processes. For complex geometries, printing with variable height
within layers offer the advantage of producing overhangs without the need for
support material or geometric decomposition. This approach has been
demonstrated for steel using precomputed robot speed profiles to achieve
consistent geometric quality. In contrast, aluminum exhibits a bead geometry
that is tightly coupled to the temperature of the previous layer, resulting in
significant changes to the height of the deposited material at different points
in the part. This paper presents a closed-loop approach to correcting for
variations in the height of the deposited material between layers. We use an IR
camera mounted on a separate robot to track the welding flame and estimate the
height of deposited material. The robot velocity profile is then updated to
account for the error in the previous layer and the nominal planned height
profile while factoring in process and system constraints. Implementation of
this framework showed significant improvement over the open-loop case and
demonstrated robustness to inaccurate model parameters.

                                        <span>  Spinning, frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars with 360 degree
coverage have been gaining popularity for autonomous-vehicle navigation.
However, unlike `fixed' automotive radar, commercially available spinning radar
systems typically do not produce radial velocities due to the lack of repeated
measurements in the same direction and the fundamental hardware setup. To make
these radial velocities observable, we modified the firmware of a commercial
spinning radar to use triangular frequency modulation. In this paper, we
develop a novel way to use this modulation to extract radial Doppler velocity
measurements from consecutive azimuths of a radar intensity scan, without any
data association. We show that these noisy, error-prone measurements contain
enough information to provide good ego-velocity estimates, and incorporate
these estimates into different modern odometry pipelines. We extensively
evaluate the pipelines on over 110 km of driving data in progressively more
geometrically challenging autonomous-driving environments. We show that Doppler
velocity measurements improve odometry in well-defined geometric conditions and
enable it to continue functioning even in severely geometrically degenerate
environments, such as long tunnels.

                                        <span>  Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated compelling performance in
robotic tasks, but its success often hinges on the design of complex, ad hoc
reward functions. Researchers have explored how Large Language Models (LLMs)
could enable non-expert users to specify reward functions more easily. However,
LLMs struggle to balance the importance of different features, generalize
poorly to out-of-distribution robotic tasks, and cannot represent the problem
properly with only text-based descriptions. To address these challenges, we
propose ELEMENTAL (intEractive LEarning froM dEmoNstraTion And Language), a
novel framework that combines natural language guidance with visual user
demonstrations to align robot behavior with user intentions better. By
incorporating visual inputs, ELEMENTAL overcomes the limitations of text-only
task specifications, while leveraging inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to
balance feature weights and match the demonstrated behaviors optimally.
ELEMENTAL also introduces an iterative feedback-loop through self-reflection to
improve feature, reward, and policy learning. Our experiment results
demonstrate that ELEMENTAL outperforms prior work by 42.3% on task success, and
achieves 41.3% better generalization in out-of-distribution tasks, highlighting
its robustness in LfD.

Calib3D, a pioneering effort to benchmark and scrutinize the reliability of 3D
scene understanding models from an uncertainty estimation viewpoint. We
comprehensively evaluate 28 state-of-the-art models across 10 diverse 3D
datasets, uncovering insightful phenomena that cope with both the aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainties in 3D scene understanding. We discover that despite
achieving impressive levels of accuracy, existing models frequently fail to
provide reliable uncertainty estimates -- a pitfall that critically undermines
their applicability in safety-sensitive contexts. Through extensive analysis of
key factors such as network capacity, LiDAR representations, rasterization
resolutions, and 3D data augmentation techniques, we correlate these aspects
directly with the model calibration efficacy. Furthermore, we introduce DeptS,
a novel depth-aware scaling approach aimed at enhancing 3D model calibration.
Extensive experiments across a wide range of configurations validate the
superiority of our method. We hope this work could serve as a cornerstone for
fostering reliable 3D scene understanding. Code and benchmark toolkit are

transition models, state estimation models, or all of the above. With these
components being learned from data, it is important to be able to analyze what
behaviors were learned and how this affects closed-loop performance. In this
paper we take steps toward this goal by developing methods for computing
control invariant sets and regions of attraction (ROAs) of dynamical systems
represented as neural networks. We focus our attention on feedforward neural
networks with the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation, which are known to
implement continuous piecewise-affine (PWA) functions. We describe the
Reachable Polyhedral Marching (RPM) algorithm for enumerating the affine pieces
of a neural network through an incremental connected walk. We then use this
algorithm to compute exact forward and backward reachable sets, from which we
provide methods for computing control invariant sets and ROAs. Our approach is
unique in that we find these sets incrementally, without Lyapunov-based tools.
In our examples we demonstrate the ability of our approach to find non-convex
control invariant sets and ROAs on tasks with learned van der Pol oscillator
and pendulum models. Further, we provide an accelerated algorithm for computing
ROAs that leverages the incremental and connected enumeration of affine regions
that RPM provides. We show this acceleration to lead to a 15x speedup in our
examples. Finally, we apply our methods to find a set of states that are
stabilized by an image-based controller for an aircraft runway control problem.

                                        <span>  Recovering metric depth from a single image remains a fundamental challenge
in computer vision, requiring both scene understanding and accurate scaling.
While deep learning has advanced monocular depth estimation, current models
often struggle with unfamiliar scenes and layouts, particularly in zero-shot
scenarios and when predicting scale-ergodic metric depth. We present
MetricGold, a novel approach that harnesses generative diffusion model's rich
priors to improve metric depth estimation. Building upon recent advances in
MariGold, DDVM and Depth Anything V2 respectively, our method combines latent
diffusion, log-scaled metric depth representation, and synthetic data training.
MetricGold achieves efficient training on a single RTX 3090 within two days
using photo-realistic synthetic data from HyperSIM, VirtualKitti, and
TartanAir. Our experiments demonstrate robust generalization across diverse
datasets, producing sharper and higher quality metric depth estimates compared
to existing approaches.

                                        <span>  Vast industrial investment along with increased academic research on
heavy-duty hydraulic manipulators has unavoidably paved the way for their
automatization, necessitating the design of robust and high-precision
controllers. In this study, an orchestrated robust controller is designed to
address the mentioned issue for generic manipulators with an anthropomorphic
arm and spherical wrist. To do so, the entire robotic system is decomposed into
subsystems, and a robust controller is designed at each local subsystem by
considering unknown model uncertainties, unknown disturbances, and compound
input nonlinearities, thanks to virtual decomposition control (VDC). As such,
radial basic function neural networks (RBFNNs) are incorporated into VDC to
tackle unknown disturbances and uncertainties, resulting in novel decentralized
RBFNNs. All robust local controllers designed at each local subsystem, then,
are orchestrated to accomplish high-precision control. In the end, for the
first time in the context of VDC, a semi-globally uniformly ultimate
boundedness is achieved under the designed controller. The validity of the
theoretical results is verified by performing extensive simulations and
experiments on a 6-degrees-of-freedom industrial manipulator with a nominal
lifting capacity of $600\, kg$ at $5$ meters reach. Comparing the simulation
result to the state-of-the-art controller along with provided experimental
results, demonstrates that proposed method established all promises and
performed excellently.

stochastic systems using infinitesimal generator learning within
infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our learning framework
leverages data samples of system dynamics and stage cost functions, with only
control penalties and constraints provided. The proposed method directly learns
the diffusion operator of a controlled Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation in an
infinite-dimensional hypothesis space. This operator models the continuous-time
evolution of the probability measure of the control system's state. We
demonstrate that this approach seamlessly integrates with modern convex
operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions, enabling a data-driven
solution to the optimal control problem. Furthermore, our statistical learning
framework includes nonparametric estimators for uncontrolled forward
infinitesimal generators as a special case. Numerical experiments, ranging from
synthetic differential equations to simulated robotic systems, showcase the
advantages of our approach compared to both modern data-driven and classical
nonlinear programming methods for optimal control.

                                        <span>  For the task of hanging clothes, learning how to insert a hanger into a
garment is crucial but has been seldom explored in robotics. In this work, we
address the problem of inserting a hanger into various unseen garments that are
initially laid out flat on a table. This task is challenging due to its
long-horizon nature, the high degrees of freedom of the garments, and the lack
of data. To simplify the learning process, we first propose breaking the task
into several stages. Then, we formulate each stage as a policy learning problem
and propose low-dimensional action parameterization. To overcome the challenge
of limited data, we build our own simulator and create 144 synthetic clothing
assets to effectively collect high-quality training data. Our approach uses
single-view depth images and object masks as input, which mitigates the
Sim2Real appearance gap and achieves high generalization capabilities for new
garments. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world validate
our proposed method. By training on various garments in the simulator, our
method achieves a 75\% success rate with 8 different unseen garments in the
real world.

                                        <span>  Air-ground robots (AGRs) are widely used in surveillance and disaster
response due to their exceptional mobility and versatility (i.e., flying and
driving). Current AGR navigation systems perform well in static occlusion-prone
environments (e.g., indoors) by using 3D semantic occupancy networks to predict
occlusions for complete local mapping and then computing Euclidean Signed
Distance Field (ESDF) for path planning. However, these systems face challenges
in dynamic, severe occlusion scenes (e.g., crowds) due to limitations in
perception networks' low prediction accuracy and path planners' high
computation overhead. In this paper, we propose OMEGA, which contains OccMamba
with an Efficient AGR-Planner to address the above-mentioned problems. OccMamba
adopts a novel architecture that separates semantic and occupancy prediction
into independent branches, incorporating two mamba blocks within these
branches. These blocks efficiently extract semantic and geometric features in
3D environments with linear complexity, ensuring that the network can learn
long-distance dependencies to improve prediction accuracy. Semantic and
geometric features are combined within the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space to
minimise computational overhead during feature fusion. The resulting semantic
occupancy map is then seamlessly integrated into the local map, providing
occlusion awareness of the dynamic environment. Our AGR-Planner utilizes this
local map and employs kinodynamic A* search and gradient-based trajectory
optimization to guarantee planning is ESDF-free and energy-efficient. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that OccMamba outperforms the state-of-the-art 3D
semantic occupancy network with 25.0% mIoU. End-to-end navigation experiments
in dynamic scenes verify OMEGA's efficiency, achieving a 96% average planning
success rate. Code and video are available at

                                        <span>  Correspondence-based point cloud registration (PCR) plays a key role in
robotics and computer vision. However, challenges like sensor noises, object
occlusions, and descriptor limitations inevitably result in numerous outliers.
RANSAC family is the most popular outlier removal solution. However, the
requisite iterations escalate exponentially with the outlier ratio, rendering
it far inferior to existing methods (SC2PCR [1], MAC [2], etc.) in terms of
accuracy or speed. Thus, we propose a two-stage consensus filtering (TCF) that
elevates RANSAC to state-of-the-art (SOTA) speed and accuracy. Firstly,
one-point RANSAC obtains a consensus set based on length consistency.
Subsequently, two-point RANSAC refines the set via angle consistency. Then,
three-point RANSAC computes a coarse pose and removes outliers based on
transformed correspondence's distances. Drawing on optimizations from one-point
and two-point RANSAC, three-point RANSAC requires only a few iterations.
Eventually, an iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) is applied to yield
the optimal pose. Experiments on the large-scale KITTI and ETH datasets
demonstrate our method achieves up to three-orders-of-magnitude speedup
compared to MAC while maintaining registration accuracy and recall. Our code is
available at https://github.com/ShiPC-AI/TCF.

                                        <span>  Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has exhibited efficacy in resolving the
Local Path Planning (LPP) problem. However, such application in the real world
is immensely limited due to the deficient training efficiency and
generalization capability of DRL. To alleviate these two issues, a solution
named Color is proposed, which consists of an Actor-Sharer-Learner (ASL)
training framework and a mobile robot-oriented simulator Sparrow. Specifically,
the ASL intends to improve the training efficiency of DRL algorithms. It
employs a Vectorized Data Collection (VDC) mode to expedite data acquisition,
decouples the data collection from model optimization by multithreading, and
partially connects the two procedures by harnessing a Time Feedback Mechanism
(TFM) to evade data underuse or overuse. Meanwhile, the Sparrow simulator
utilizes a 2D grid-based world, simplified kinematics, and conversion-free data
flow to achieve a lightweight design. The lightness facilitates vectorized
diversity, allowing diversified simulation setups across extensive copies of
the vectorized environments, resulting in a notable enhancement in the
generalization capability of the DRL algorithm being trained. Comprehensive
experiments, comprising 57 DRL benchmark environments, 32 simulated and 36
real-world LPP scenarios, have been conducted to corroborate the superiority of
our method in terms of efficiency and generalization. The code and the video of

                                        <span>  To enable non-experts to specify long-horizon, multi-robot collaborative
tasks, language models are increasingly used to translate natural language
commands into formal specifications. However, because translation can occur in
multiple ways, such translations may lack accuracy or lead to inefficient
multi-robot planning. Our key insight is that concise hierarchical
specifications can simplify planning while remaining straightforward to derive
from human instructions. We propose Nl2Hltl2Plan, a framework that translates
natural language commands into hierarchical Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and
solves the corresponding planning problem. The translation involves two steps
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). First, an LLM transforms instructions
into a Hierarchical Task Tree, capturing logical and temporal relations. Next,
a fine-tuned LLM converts sub-tasks into flat LTL formulas, which are
aggregated into hierarchical specifications, with the lowest level
corresponding to ordered robot actions. These specifications are then used with
off-the-shelf planners. Our Nl2Hltl2Plan demonstrates the potential of LLMs in
hierarchical reasoning for multi-robot task planning. Evaluations in simulation
and real-world experiments with human participants show that Nl2Hltl2Plan
outperforms existing methods, handling more complex instructions while
achieving higher success rates and lower costs in task allocation and planning.

                                        <span>  Applications from manipulation to autonomous vehicles rely on robust and
general object tracking to safely perform tasks in dynamic environments. We
propose the first certifiably optimal category-level approach for simultaneous
shape estimation and pose tracking of an object of known category (e.g. a car).
Our approach uses 3D semantic keypoint measurements extracted from an RGB-D
image sequence, and phrases the estimation as a fixed-lag smoothing problem.
Temporal constraints enforce the object's rigidity (fixed shape) and smooth
motion according to a constant-twist motion model. The solutions to this
problem are the estimates of the object's state (poses, velocities) and shape
(paramaterized according to the active shape model) over the smoothing horizon.
Our key contribution is to show that despite the non-convexity of the fixed-lag
smoothing problem, we can solve it to certifiable optimality using a small-size
semidefinite relaxation. We also present a fast outlier rejection scheme that
filters out incorrect keypoint detections with shape and time compatibility
tests, and wrap our certifiable solver in a graduated non-convexity scheme. We
evaluate the proposed approach on synthetic and real data, showcasing its
performance in a table-top manipulation scenario and a drone-based vehicle
tracking application.

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in robotics have enabled robots to navigate complex
scenes or manipulate diverse objects independently. However, robots are still
impotent in many household tasks requiring coordinated behaviors such as
opening doors. The factorization of navigation and manipulation, while
effective for some tasks, fails in scenarios requiring coordinated actions. To
address this challenge, we introduce, HarmonicMM, an end-to-end learning method
that optimizes both navigation and manipulation, showing notable improvement
over existing techniques in everyday tasks. This approach is validated in
simulated and real-world environments and adapts to novel unseen settings
without additional tuning. Our contributions include a new benchmark for mobile
manipulation and the successful deployment with only RGB visual observation in
a real unseen apartment, demonstrating the potential for practical indoor robot
deployment in daily life. More results are on our project site:

Additionally, GARD provides unique functionalities such as area-restricted free

like New York City (NYC), where traffic congestion significantly impedes
emergency vehicle (EMV) mobility. This study introduces an intersection-aware
emergency medical service (EMS) accessibility model to evaluate and improve EMV
travel times across NYC. Integrating intersection density metrics, road network
characteristics, and demographic data, the model identifies vulnerable regions
with inadequate EMS coverage. The analysis reveals that densely interconnected
areas, such as parts of Staten Island, Queens, and Manhattan, experience
significant accessibility deficits due to intersection delays and sparse
medical infrastructure. To address these challenges, this study explores the
adoption of EMVLight, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, which
demonstrates the potential to reduce intersection delays by 50\%, increasing
EMS accessibility to 95\% of NYC residents within the critical benchmark of 4
minutes. Results indicate that advanced traffic signal control (TSC) systems
can alleviate congestion-induced delays while improving equity in emergency
response. The findings provide actionable insights for urban planning and
policy interventions to enhance EMS accessibility and ensure timely care for
underserved populations.

                                        <span>  Lane change decision-making is a complex task due to intricate
vehicle-vehicle and vehicle-infrastructure interactions. Existing algorithms
for lane-change control often depend on vehicles with a certain level of
autonomy (e.g., autonomous or connected autonomous vehicles). To address the
challenges posed by low penetration rates of autonomous vehicles and the high
costs of precise data collection, this study proposes a dynamic lane change
regulation design based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance
freeway traffic efficiency. The proposed framework leverages multi-lane
macroscopic traffic models that describe spatial-temporal dynamics of the
density and speed for each lane. Lateral traffic flow between adjacent lanes,
resulting from aggregated lane-changing behaviors, is modeled as source terms
exchanged between the partial differential equations (PDEs). We propose a lane
change regulation strategy using MARL, where one agent is placed at each
discretized lane grid. The state of each agent is represented by aggregated
vehicle attributes within its grid, generated from the SUMO microscopic
simulation environment. The agent's actions are lane-change regulations for
vehicles in its grid. Specifically, lane-change regulation signals are computed
at a centralized traffic management center and then broadcast to connected
vehicles in the corresponding lane grids. Compared to vehicle-level maneuver
control, this approach achieves a higher regulation rate by leveraging vehicle
connectivity while introducing no critical safety concerns, and accommodating
varying levels of connectivity and autonomy within the traffic system. The
proposed model is simulated and evaluated in varied traffic scenarios and
demand conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the method improves
overall traffic efficiency with minimal additional energy consumption while
maintaining driving safety.

applying it to environments with constraints remains challenging due to poor
sample efficiency and slow convergence. Recent literature explored
incorporating model knowledge to mitigate these problems, particularly through
the use of models that assess the feasibility of proposed actions. However,
integrating feasibility models efficiently into DRL pipelines in environments
with continuous action spaces is non-trivial. We propose a novel DRL training
strategy utilizing action mapping that leverages feasibility models to
streamline the learning process. By decoupling the learning of feasible actions
from policy optimization, action mapping allows DRL agents to focus on
selecting the optimal action from a reduced feasible action set. We demonstrate
through experiments that action mapping significantly improves training
performance in constrained environments with continuous action spaces,
especially with imperfect feasibility models.

                                        <span>  Cooperative driving of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) emerges as a
promising solution to enhance traffic safety, efficiency, and sustainability.
Meanwhile, mixed traffic, where CAVs coexist with conventional human-driven
vehicles (HDVs), represents an upcoming and necessary stage in the development
of intelligent transportation systems. Considering the motion uncertainty of
HDVs, this paper proposes a coordinated control method for trajectory planning
of CAVs at an unsignalized intersection in mixed traffic. By sampling in
distance and using an exact change of variables, the coordinated control
problem is formulated as a nonlinear program in the spatial domain, thereby
allowing for unified linear collision avoidance constraints to handle crossing,
following, merging, and diverging vehicle conflicts. The motion uncertainty of
HDVs is decoupled and modeled as path uncertainty and speed uncertainty,
whereby the robustness of collision avoidance is ensured in both spatial and
temporal dimensions. The prediction deviation for HDVs is compensated by
receding horizon optimization, and a real-time iteration (RTI) scheme is
developed to improve computational efficiency. Simulation case studies are
conducted to validate the efficacy, robustness, and potential for real-time
application of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed control
scheme provides collision-free and smooth trajectories with state and control
constraints satisfied. Compared with the converged baseline, the RTI scheme
reduces the computation time by a factor of 111 on average, and the solution
deviation is less than 2.26%, demonstrating a good trade-off between
computational effort and optimality.

effective operation of induction machines, particularly given the real-world
challenges present in industrial datasets, such as significant imbalances
between healthy and faulty samples and the scarcity of data representing faulty
conditions. This research introduces an innovative meta-learning approach to
address these issues, focusing on mechanical fault detection in induction
motors across diverse operating conditions while mitigating the adverse effects
of drive noise in scenarios with limited data. The process of identifying
faults under varying operating conditions is framed as a few-shot
classification challenge and approached through a model-agnostic meta-learning
strategy. Specifically, this approach begins with training a meta-learner
across multiple interconnected fault-diagnosis tasks conducted under different
operating conditions. In this stage, cross-entropy is utilized to optimize
parameters and develop a robust representation of the tasks. Subsequently, the
parameters of the meta-learner are fine-tuned for new tasks, enabling rapid
adaptation using only a small number of samples. This method achieves excellent
accuracy in fault detection across various conditions, even when data
availability is restricted. The findings indicate that the proposed model
outperforms other sophisticated techniques, providing enhanced generalization
and quicker adaptation. The accuracy of fault diagnosis reaches a minimum of
99%, underscoring the model's effectiveness for reliable fault identification.

present a novel exploration-based algorithm for falsification of black-box
models of hybrid systems based on the Voronoi bias in the output space. This
approach is inspired by techniques used originally in motion planning: rapidly
exploring random trees. Instead of commonly employed exploration that is based
on coverage of inputs, the proposed algorithm aims to cover all possible

also does not require robustness or other guidance metrics tied to a specific
behavior that is being falsified. This allows our algorithm to falsify
specifications for which robustness is not conclusive enough to guide the
falsification procedure.

it is crucial to identify performance limitations across various subsystems. A
timetable-independent assessment of infrastructure capacity at railway
junctions is a fundamental aspect of long-term rail network planning. While
recent research introduced queueing-based methods to quantify route-based
railway junction performance, modelling arrival and service processes has been
limited to exponential distributions. This work utilizes Phase-Type
Distributions to propose an extension to a previously described Continuous-Time
Markov Chain model. In a comparison between assumed distribution combinations,
the effect of a more detailed stochastic process modelling is described.
Furthermore, an analysis of the differences to a simulation method is conducted
for an exemplary railway junction. The introduced method enables infrastructure
managers to accurately model stochastic processes for performance determination
in the early stages of the strategic planning phase.

citizens, it might be daunting when trying to introduce a product, whether
innovative or not. In the current world, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are
ubiquitous in our daily lives. Cars can provide intrusive assistance as they
can brake or turn wheels on their own, buildings are getting smarter to
optimize energy consumption, smart cities are emerging to facilitate
information sharing and orchestrate the response to emergency situations, etc.
As the presence of such tools will grow in the coming years and people will
rely even more on CPSs, we certainly need to ensure that they are safe and
reliable for users or everybody else, which is why regulations are so
important. However, compliance should not act as a barrier to new actors coming
to the European market. Nor should it prevent current actors from keeping
systems deemed compliant when introduced while obsolete at the time they are
used. While the individual elements we point out might not bring novelty in the
various research areas we cover (EU policies, requirements engineering,
business engineering, and software engineering), this paper identifies the
challenges related to building and testing a CPS with respect to applicable
laws and discusses the difficulty of automating the response to those
challenges, such as finding a relevant legal text, paying for mentioned
materials or identifying the level of compliance to a legal text. Our analysis
of the holistic context when considering the compliance testing of CPS provides
an overview enabling more effective decision-making as well.

                                        <span>  This study addresses the intricate challenge of decentralized output-feedback
control for stochastic non-triangular nonlinear interconnected systems with
unknown time-varying sensor sensitivity in a dynamic event-triggered context.
The presence of stochastic disturbances, non-triangular structural
uncertainties, and evolving sensor sensitivity distinguishes this problem of
global asymptotic stability from conventional event-triggered control
scenarios. Existing event-triggered control approaches with static event
conditions encounter difficulties in simultaneously ensuring zero
tracking/stabilization error and preventing the occurrence of Zeno behavior. In
this work, we develop a novel solution to address this complex issue. Firstly,
we establish a linear relationship between the state vector of each
interconnected subsystem and two error vectors through a unique coordinate
transformation. This transformation effectively handles the complexities
introduced by non-triangular structural uncertainties. Secondly, we introduce a
decentralized dynamic event-triggered output-feedback control strategy, which
involves a state observer and a decentralized output-feedback controller.
Unlike conventional event-triggered control methods with static event
conditions, this strategy formulates a modified clock-based dynamic triggering
mechanism by introducing an auxiliary variable that evolves based on predicted
plant state values, while utilizing a clock variable to guarantee the existence
of a positive lower bound on inter-execution times. Rigorous Lyapunov analysis
confirms the global asymptotic stability in probability of the closed-loop
system, with the states and the output of each local subsystem converging to
the equilibrium at the origin in probability. Additionally, the existence of a
minimal dwell-time between triggering instants is guaranteed.

                                        <span>  When deploying autonomous systems in unknown and changing environments, it is
critical that their motion planning and control algorithms are computationally
efficient and can be reapplied online in real time, whilst providing
theoretical safety guarantees in the presence of disturbances. The satisfaction
of these objectives becomes more challenging when considering time-varying
dynamics and disturbances, which arise in real-world contexts. We develop
methods with the potential to address these issues by applying an
offline-computed safety guaranteeing controller on a physical system, to track
a virtual system that evolves through a trajectory that is replanned online,
accounting for constraints updated online. The first method we propose is
designed for general time-varying systems over a finite horizon. Our second
method overcomes the finite horizon restriction for periodic systems. We
simulate our algorithms on a case study of an autonomous underwater vehicle
subject to wave disturbances.

intermittent renewable power, such as wind, optimally to support thermal
inertial loads in a microgrid environment. Thermal inertial loads can be
programmed to preferentially consume from renewable sources. The flexibility in
power consumption of inertial loads therefore can be used to absorb the
fluctuations in intermittently available renewable power sources, and promote
reduction of fossil fuel based costly non-renewable generation. Under a model
which promotes renewable consumption by penalizing the non-renewable, but does
not account for variations in the end-user requirements, the optimal solution
leads to all the users' temperatures behave in a lockstep fashion, that is the
power is allocated in such a fashion that all the temperatures are brought to a
common value and they are kept the same after that point, resulting in
synchronization among all the loads. In the first part, we showed that under a
model which additionally penalizes the comfort range violation, the optimal
solution is in-fact of desynchronization nature, where the temperatures are
intentionally kept apart to avoid power surges resulting from simultaneous
comfort violation from many loads.

Transmissions (S-AMT) in powered two-wheelers, a powertrain setup that allows
fast and smooth gear shifts with minimal modifications to the traditional

the electronic clutch and engine torque, excellent gearshift performance can be
obtained, but requires precise parameters calibration. We thus propose the use
of a data-driven approach with Constrained Bayesian Optimization to optimize
control parameters. The procedure's effectiveness is demonstrated on a real

execute the underwater target tracking task collaboratively. However, it's
pretty challenging to meet various prerequisites utilizing traditional control
methods. Therefore, we propose an effective two-stage learning from
demonstrations training framework, FISHER, to highlight the adaptability of
reinforcement learning (RL) methods in the multi-AUV underwater target tracking
task, while addressing its limitations such as extensive requirements for
environmental interactions and the challenges in designing reward functions.
The first stage utilizes imitation learning (IL) to realize policy improvement
and generate offline datasets. To be specific, we introduce multi-agent
discriminator-actor-critic based on improvements of the generative adversarial
IL algorithm and multi-agent IL optimization objective derived from the Nash
equilibrium condition. Then in the second stage, we develop multi-agent
independent generalized decision transformer, which analyzes the latent
representation to match the future states of high-quality samples rather than
reward function, attaining further enhanced policies capable of handling
various scenarios. Besides, we propose a simulation to simulation demonstration
generation procedure to facilitate the generation of expert demonstrations in
underwater environments, which capitalizes on traditional control methods and
can easily accomplish the domain transfer to obtain demonstrations. Extensive
simulation experiments from multiple scenarios showcase that FISHER possesses
strong stability, multi-task performance and capability of generalization.

                                        <span>  This paper develops a physics-informed scenario approach for safety
verification of nonlinear systems using barrier certificates (BCs) to ensure
that system trajectories remain within safe regions over an infinite time
horizon. Designing BCs often relies on an accurate dynamics model; however,
such models are often imprecise due to the model complexity involved,
particularly when dealing with highly nonlinear systems. In such cases, while
scenario approaches effectively address the safety problem using collected data
to construct a guaranteed BC for the dynamical system, they often require
substantial amounts of data-sometimes millions of samples-due to exponential
sample complexity. To address this, we propose a physics-informed scenario
approach that selects data samples such that the outputs of the physics-based
model and the observed data are sufficiently close (within a specified
threshold). This approach guides the scenario optimization process to eliminate
redundant samples and significantly reduce the required dataset size. We
demonstrate the capability of our approach in mitigating the amount of data
required for scenario optimizations with both deterministic (i.e., confidence
1) and probabilistic (i.e., confidence between 0 and 1) guarantees. We validate
our physics-informed scenario approach through two physical case studies,
showcasing its practical application in reducing the required data.

reinforcement learning (RL) showing promising potential for automated traffic
signal control. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is particularly
effective for learning control strategies for traffic lights in a network using
iterative simulations. However, existing methods often assume perfect vehicle
detection, which overlooks real-world limitations related to infrastructure
availability and sensor reliability. This study proposes a co-simulation
framework integrating CARLA and SUMO, which combines high-fidelity 3D modeling
with large-scale traffic flow simulation. Cameras mounted on traffic light
poles within the CARLA environment use a YOLO-based computer vision system to
detect and count vehicles, providing real-time traffic data as input for
adaptive signal control in SUMO. MARL agents, trained with four different
reward structures, leverage this visual feedback to optimize signal timings and
improve network-wide traffic flow. Experiments in the test-bed demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed MARL approach in enhancing traffic conditions
using real-time camera-based detection. The framework also evaluates the
robustness of MARL under faulty or sparse sensing and compares the performance
of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for vehicle detection. Results show that while better
accuracy improves performance, MARL agents can still achieve significant
improvements with imperfect detection, demonstrating adaptability for
real-world scenarios.

ensure that small input variations result in proportionally minor deviations in
the state of a nonlinear system. This property is essential in practical
applications where input precision cannot be guaranteed. However, analyzing
delta-ISS demands detailed knowledge of system dynamics to assess the state's
incremental response to input changes, posing a challenge in real-world
scenarios where mathematical models are unknown. In this work, we develop a
data-driven approach to design delta-ISS Lyapunov functions together with their
corresponding delta-ISS controllers for continuous-time input-affine nonlinear
systems with polynomial dynamics, ensuring the delta-ISS property is achieved
without requiring knowledge of the system dynamics. In our data-driven scheme,
we collect only two sets of input-state trajectories from sufficiently excited
dynamics, as introduced by Willems et al.'s fundamental lemma. By fulfilling a
specific rank condition, we design delta-ISS controllers using the collected
samples through formulating a sum-of-squares optimization program. The
effectiveness of our data-driven approach is evidenced by its application on a

                                        <span>  Finite abstractions (a.k.a. symbolic models) offer an effective scheme for
approximating the complex continuous-space systems with simpler models in the
discrete-space domain. A crucial aspect, however, is to establish a formal
relation between the original system and its symbolic model, ensuring that a
discrete controller designed for the symbolic model can be effectively
implemented as a hybrid controller (using an interface map) for the original
system. This task becomes even more challenging when the exact mathematical
model of the continuous-space system is unknown. To address this, the existing
literature mainly employs scenario-based data-driven methods, which require
collecting a large amount of data from the original system. In this work, we
propose a data-driven framework that utilizes only two input-state trajectories
collected from unknown nonlinear polynomial systems to synthesize a hybrid
controller, enabling the desired behavior on the unknown system through the
controller derived from its symbolic model. To accomplish this, we employ the
concept of alternating simulation functions (ASFs) to quantify the closeness
between the state trajectories of the unknown system and its data-driven
symbolic model. By satisfying a specific rank condition on the collected data,
which intuitively ensures that the unknown system is persistently excited, we
directly design an ASF and its corresponding hybrid controller using
finite-length data without explicitly identifying the unknown system, while
providing correctness guarantees. This is achieved through proposing a
data-based sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program, enabling a systematic
approach to the design process. We illustrate the effectiveness of our
data-driven approach through a case study.

dimensional residual model is proposed for autonomous driving. One of the
critical challenge in autonomous driving is the complexity of vehicle dynamics,
which impedes the formulation of accurate vehicle model. Inaccurate vehicle
model can significantly impact the performance of MPC controller. To address
this issue, this paper decomposes the nominal vehicle model into invariable and
variable elements. The accuracy of invariable component is ensured by
calibration, while the deviations in the variable elements are learned by a
low-dimensional residual model. The features of residual model are selected as
the physical variables most correlated with nominal model errors. Physical
constraints among these features are formulated to explicitly define the valid
region within the feature space. The formulated model and constraints are
incorporated into the MPC framework and validated through both simulation and
real vehicle experiments. The results indicate that the proposed method
significantly enhances the model accuracy and controller performance.

                                        <span>  Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) is the process of optimizing the
development and upgrade of the power grid to ensure reliable, efficient, and
cost-effective electricity delivery while addressing grid constraints. To
support growing demand and renewable energy integration, energy storage is
emerging as a pivotal asset that provides temporal flexibility and alleviates
congestion. This paper presents a TEP model that incorporates the sizing and
siting of short-duration storage. With a focus on high spatial resolution, the
model is applied to a 2,000-bus synthetic Texas power system, offering detailed
insights into geographic investment and operational patterns. To maintain
computational feasibility, a simple yet effective storage candidates (SC)
method is introduced, significantly reducing the search space. Results
highlight that transmission investments are primarily driven by renewable
energy expansion, while storage investments are shaped by renewable curtailment
and load-shedding events, with their primary function being peak load shaving.
The findings underscore the importance of co-optimizing transmission and
storage to minimize costs and enhance grid reliability. However, limitations in
the ability of the SC method to identify optimal storage locations to meet
long-term needs suggest opportunities for future research, including dynamic
candidate selection and hybrid optimization techniques.

                                        <span>  Robots in densely populated real-world environments frequently encounter
constrained and cluttered situations such as passing through narrow doorways,
hallways, and corridor intersections, where conflicts over limited space result
in collisions or deadlocks among the robots. Current decentralized
state-of-the-art optimization- and neural network-based approaches (i) are
predominantly designed for general open spaces, and (ii) are overly
conservative, either guaranteeing safety, or liveness, but not both. While some
solutions rely on centralized conflict resolution, their highly invasive
trajectories make them impractical for real-world deployment. This paper
introduces LiveNet, a fully decentralized and robust neural network controller
that enables human-like yielding and passing, resulting in agile,
non-conservative, deadlock-free, and safe, navigation in congested,
conflict-prone spaces. LiveNet is minimally invasive, without requiring
inter-agent communication or cooperative behavior. The key insight behind
LiveNet is a unified CBF formulation for simultaneous safety and liveness,
which we integrate within a neural network for robustness. We evaluated LiveNet
in simulation and found that general multi-robot optimization- and
learning-based navigation methods fail to even reach the goal, and while
methods designed specially for such environments do succeed, they are 10-20
times slower, 4-5 times more invasive, and much less robust to variations in
the scenario configuration such as changes in the start states and goal states,
among others. We open-source the LiveNet code at

                                        <span>  Safety filters leveraging control barrier functions (CBFs) are highly
effective for enforcing safe behavior on complex systems. It is often easier to
synthesize CBFs for a Reduced order Model (RoM), and track the resulting safe
behavior on the Full order Model (FoM) -- yet gaps between the RoM and FoM can
result in safety violations. This paper introduces \emph{predictive CBFs} to
address this gap by leveraging rollouts of the FoM to define a predictive
robustness term added to the RoM CBF condition. Theoretically, we prove that
this guarantees safety in a layered control implementation. Practically, we
learn the predictive robustness term through massive parallel simulation with
domain randomization. We demonstrate in simulation that this yields safe FoM
behavior with minimal conservatism, and experimentally realize predictive CBFs
on a 3D hopping robot.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes a novel perimeter-free regional traffic management
strategy for traffic networks under a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV)
environment. The proposed strategy requires CAVs, especially those with long
remaining travel distances, to temporarily wait at nearby parking facilities
when the network is congested. After a designated holding time, these CAVs are
allowed to re-enter the network. Doing so helps reduce congestion and improve
overall operational efficiency. Unlike traditional perimeter control approaches
that restrict inflows to congested regions, the proposed holding strategy
leverages existing parking infrastructure to temporarily hold vehicles in a way
that partially avoids local queue accumulation issues. The proposed method can
be easily integrated with existing signal control methods and retains the
maximum stability property of the original traffic signal control methods.
Simulation results show that the proposed strategy not only reduces travel time
for vehicles that are not held, but can also reduce travel times for some of
the held vehicles as well, which serves as another key merit of the proposed
approach. Compared to the two benchmark perimeter control algorithms, the
proposed strategy is more robust against demand patterns and generates stronger
improvements in the operational efficiency. Importantly, since the proposed
strategy requires existing parking infrastructure, its performance has been
demonstrated under various configurations of parking locations and capacities.
Lastly, the proposed strategy is shown to be beneficial in a partial CAV
environment where only a subset of vehicles are available for holding.

                                        <span>  Modeling late reverberation at interactive speeds is a challenging task when
multiple sound sources and listeners are present in the same environment. This
is especially problematic when the environment is geometrically complex and/or
features uneven energy absorption (e.g. coupled volumes), because in such cases
the late reverberation is dependent on the sound sources' and listeners'
positions, and therefore must be adapted to their movements in real time. We
present a novel approach to the task, named modal decomposition of Acoustic
Radiance Transfer (MoD-ART), which can handle highly complex scenarios with
efficiency. The approach is based on the geometrical acoustics method of
Acoustic Radiance Transfer, from which we extract a set of energy decay modes
and their positional relationships with sources and listeners. In this paper,
we describe the physical and mathematical meaningfulness of MoD-ART,
highlighting its advantages and applicability to different scenarios. Through
an analysis of the method's computational complexity, we show that it compares
very favourably with ray-tracing. We also present simulation results showing
that MoD-ART can capture multiple decay slopes and flutter echoes.

disturbances, and constraints. The tool includes customizable constraint
handling, disturbance generation, reward function design, and enables
comparison of RL algorithms against Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)
across different scenarios. Case studies demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in evaluating RL approaches for systems like continuously stirred
tank reactors, multistage extraction processes, and crystallization reactors.
The results reveal performance gaps between RL algorithms and NMPC oracles,
highlighting areas for improvement and enabling benchmarking. By providing a
standardized platform, PC-Gym aims to accelerate research at the intersection
of machine learning, control, and process systems engineering. By connecting
theoretical RL advances with practical industrial process control applications,
offering researchers a tool for exploring data-driven control solutions.

                                        <span>  Neural networks are increasingly used in robotics as policies, state
transition models, state estimation models, or all of the above. With these
components being learned from data, it is important to be able to analyze what
behaviors were learned and how this affects closed-loop performance. In this
paper we take steps toward this goal by developing methods for computing
control invariant sets and regions of attraction (ROAs) of dynamical systems
represented as neural networks. We focus our attention on feedforward neural
networks with the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation, which are known to
implement continuous piecewise-affine (PWA) functions. We describe the
Reachable Polyhedral Marching (RPM) algorithm for enumerating the affine pieces
of a neural network through an incremental connected walk. We then use this
algorithm to compute exact forward and backward reachable sets, from which we
provide methods for computing control invariant sets and ROAs. Our approach is
unique in that we find these sets incrementally, without Lyapunov-based tools.
In our examples we demonstrate the ability of our approach to find non-convex
control invariant sets and ROAs on tasks with learned van der Pol oscillator
and pendulum models. Further, we provide an accelerated algorithm for computing
ROAs that leverages the incremental and connected enumeration of affine regions
that RPM provides. We show this acceleration to lead to a 15x speedup in our
examples. Finally, we apply our methods to find a set of states that are
stabilized by an image-based controller for an aircraft runway control problem.

                                        <span>  We provide two methods for computation of continuum backstepping kernels that
arise in control of continua (ensembles) of linear hyperbolic PDEs and which
can approximate backstepping kernels arising in control of a large-scale, PDE
system counterpart (with computational complexity that does not grow with the
number of state components of the large-scale system). In the first method, we
provide explicit formulae for the solution to the continuum kernels PDEs,
employing a (triple) power series representation of the continuum kernel and
establishing its convergence properties. In this case, we also provide means
for reducing computational complexity by properly truncating the power series
(in the powers of the ensemble variable). In the second method, we identify a
class of systems for which the solution to the continuum (and hence, also an
approximate solution to the respective large-scale) kernel equations can be
constructed in closed form. We also present numerical examples to illustrate
computational efficiency/accuracy of the approaches, as well as to validate the
stabilization properties of the approximate control kernels, constructed based
on the continuum.

                                        <span>  This paper presents a novel approach for optimal control of nonlinear
stochastic systems using infinitesimal generator learning within
infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our learning framework
leverages data samples of system dynamics and stage cost functions, with only
control penalties and constraints provided. The proposed method directly learns
the diffusion operator of a controlled Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation in an
infinite-dimensional hypothesis space. This operator models the continuous-time
evolution of the probability measure of the control system's state. We
demonstrate that this approach seamlessly integrates with modern convex
operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions, enabling a data-driven
solution to the optimal control problem. Furthermore, our statistical learning
framework includes nonparametric estimators for uncontrolled forward
infinitesimal generators as a special case. Numerical experiments, ranging from
synthetic differential equations to simulated robotic systems, showcase the
advantages of our approach compared to both modern data-driven and classical
nonlinear programming methods for optimal control.

                                        <span>  Given a set of measurements, observability characterizes the
distinguishability of a system's initial state, whereas constructability
focuses on the final state in a trajectory. In the presence of process and/or
measurement noise, the Fisher information matrices with respect to the initial
and final states$\unicode{x2013}$equivalent to the stochastic observability and
constructability Gramians$\unicode{x2013}$bound the performance of
corresponding estimators through the Cram\'er-Rao inequality. This letter
establishes a connection between stochastic observability and constructability
of discrete-time linear systems and provides a more numerically stable way for
calculating the stochastic observability Gramian. We define a dual system and
show that the dual system's stochastic constructability is equivalent to the
original system's stochastic observability, and vice versa. This duality
enables the interchange of theorems and tools for observability and
constructability. For example, we use this result to translate an existing
recursive formula for the stochastic constructability Gramian into a formula
for recursively calculating the stochastic observability Gramian for both
time-varying and time-invariant systems, and we show the convergence of this
sequence for the latter. Finally, we illustrate the robustness of our formula
compared to existing (non-recursive) formulas through a numerical example.

novel iterative algorithm named EXtremum-seeking Policy iteration LQR
(EXP-LQR). The peculiarity of EXP-LQR is that it only needs access to a
truncated approximation of the infinite-horizon cost associated to a given
policy. Hence, EXP-LQR does not need the direct knowledge of neither the system
matrices, cost matrices, and state measurements. In particular, at each
iteration, EXP-LQR refines the maintained policy using a truncated LQR cost
retrieved by performing finite-time virtual or real experiments in which a
perturbed version of the current policy is employed. Such a perturbation is
done according to an extremum-seeking mechanism and makes the overall algorithm
a time-varying nonlinear system. By using a Lyapunov-based approach exploiting
averaging theory, we show that EXP-LQR exponentially converges to an
arbitrarily small neighborhood of the optimal gain matrix. We corroborate the
theoretical results with numerical simulations involving the control of an
induction motor.

of industrial machines. Two main challenges affect the design of
high-performing intelligent systems: (i) the selection of a suitable model and
(ii) domain adaptation if there is a continuous change in operating conditions.
Therefore, we propose an evolutionary Net2Net transformation (EvoN2N) that
finds the best suitable DNN architecture with limited availability of labeled
data samples. Net2Net transformation-based quick learning algorithm has been
used in the evolutionary framework of Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm
II to obtain the best DNN architecture. Net2Net transformation-based quick
learning algorithm uses the concept of knowledge transfer from one generation
to the next for faster fitness evaluation. The proposed framework can obtain
the best model for intelligent fault diagnosis without a long and
time-consuming search process. The proposed framework has been validated on the
Case Western Reserve University dataset, the Paderborn University dataset, and
the gearbox fault detection dataset under different operating conditions. The
best models obtained are capable of demonstrating an excellent diagnostic
performance and classification accuracy of almost up to 100\% for most of the
operating conditions.

                                        <span>  This paper presents a novel decision-focused framework integrating the
physical energy storage model into machine learning pipelines. Motivated by the
model predictive control for energy storage, our end-to-end method incorporates
the prior knowledge of the storage model and infers the hidden reward that
incentivizes energy storage decisions. This is achieved through a dual-layer
framework, combining a prediction layer with an optimization layer. We
introduce the perturbation idea into the designed decision-focused loss
function to ensure the differentiability over linear storage models, supported
by a theoretical analysis of the perturbed loss function. We also develop a
hybrid loss function for effective model training. We provide two challenging
applications for our proposed framework: energy storage arbitrage, and energy
storage behavior prediction. The numerical experiments on real price data
demonstrate that our arbitrage approach achieves the highest profit against
existing methods. The numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world energy
storage data show that our approach achieves the best behavior prediction
performance against existing benchmark methods, which shows the effectiveness
of our method.

                                        <span>  New solutions for problems in optimal scheduling of activities in a project
under temporal constraints are developed in the framework of tropical algebra
which deals with the theory and application of algebraic systems with
idempotent operations. We start with a constrained tropical optimization
problem that has an objective function represented as a vector form given by an
arbitrary matrix, and that can be solved analytically in a closed but somewhat
complicated form. We examine a special case of the problem when the objective
function is given by a matrix of unit rank, and show that the solution can be
sufficiently refined in this case, which results in an essentially simplified
analytical form and reduced computational complexity of the solution. We
exploit the obtained result to find complete solutions of project scheduling
problems to minimize the project makespan and the maximum absolute deviation of
start times of activities under temporal constraints. The constraints under
consideration include ``start--start'', ``start--finish'' and ``finish--start''
precedence relations, release times, release deadlines and completion deadlines
for activities. As an application, we consider optimal scheduling problems of a
vaccination project in a medical centre.

                                        <span>  As the dimension of a system increases, traditional methods for control and
differential games rapidly become intractable, making the design of safe
autonomous agents challenging in complex or team settings. Deep-learning
approaches avoid discretization and yield numerous successes in robotics and
autonomy, but at a higher dimensional limit, accuracy falls as sampling becomes
less efficient. We propose using rapidly generated linear solutions to the
partial differential equation (PDE) arising in the problem to accelerate and
improve learned value functions for guidance in high-dimensional, nonlinear
problems. We define two programs that combine supervision of the linear
solution with a standard PDE loss. We demonstrate that these programs offer
improvements in speed and accuracy in both a 50-D differential game problem and
a 10-D quadrotor control problem.

quantum information science at large, yet remain largely unexplored. Here, we
combine quantum filtering theory and moment-sum-of-squares techniques to
construct a hierarchy of convex optimization problems that furnish
monotonically improving, computable bounds on the best attainable performance
for a broad class of quantum feedback control problems. These bounds may serve
as witnesses of fundamental limitations, optimality certificates, or
performance targets. We prove convergence of the bounds to the optimal control
performance under technical conditions and demonstrate the practical utility of
our approach by designing certifiably near-optimal controllers for a qubit in a
cavity subjected to photon counting and homodyne detection measurements.

developed for stroke patients. GARD offers assistance force along or towards a
2D trajectory during physical therapy sessions. GARD employs a non-backdrivable
mechanism with novel motor velocity-control-based algorithms, which offers
superior control precision and stability. To our knowledge, this innovative
technical route has not been previously explored in rehabilitation robotics. In
alignment with the new design, GARD features two novel control algorithms:
Implicit Euler Velocity Control (IEVC) algorithm and a generalized impedance
control algorithm. These algorithms achieve O(n) runtime complexity for any
arbitrary trajectory. The system has demonstrated a mean absolute error of
0.023mm in trajectory-following tasks and 0.14mm in trajectory-restricted free
moving tasks. The proposed upper limb rehabilitation device offers all the
functionalities of existing commercial devices with superior performance.
Additionally, GARD provides unique functionalities such as area-restricted free
moving and dynamic Motion Restriction Map interaction. This device holds strong
potential for widespread clinical use, potentially improving rehabilitation
outcomes for stroke patients.

                                        <span>  Advancements in sensor technology offer significant insights into vehicle
conditions, unlocking new venues to enhance fleet operations. While current
vehicle health management models provide accurate predictions of vehicle
failures, they often fail to integrate these forecasts into operational
decision-making, limiting their practical impact. This paper addresses this gap
by incorporating sensor-driven failure predictions into a single-vehicle
routing problem with time windows. A maintenance cost function is introduced to
balance two critical trade-offs: premature maintenance, which leads to
underutilization of remaining useful life, and delayed maintenance, which
increases the likelihood of breakdowns. Routing problems with time windows are
inherently challenging, and integrating maintenance considerations adds
significantly to its computational complexity. To address this, we develop a
new solution method, called the Iterative Alignment Method (IAM), building on
the structural properties of the problem. IAM generates high-quality solutions
even in large-size instances where Gurobi cannot find any solutions. Moreover,
compared to the traditional periodic maintenance strategy, our sensor-driven
approach to maintenance decisions shows improvements in operational and
maintenance costs as well as in overall vehicle reliability.

optimally placing the sensors to maximize their ability to localize the targets

                                        <span>  Motivated by the optimality system associated with controlled (forward)
Volterra integral equations (FVIEs, for short), the well-posedness of coupled
forward-backward Voterra integral equations (FBVIEs, for short) is studied. The
main feature of FBVIEs is that the unknown $\{(X(t,s),Y(t,s))\}$ has two
arguments. By taking $t$ as a parameter and $s$ as a (time) variable, one can
regard FBVIE as a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs, for short),
with infinite-dimensional space values
$\{(X(\cdot,s),Y(\cdot,s));\,s\in[0,T]\}$. To establish the well-posedness of
such an FBVIE, a new non-local monotonicity condition is introduced, by which a
bridge in infinite-dimensional spaces is constructed. Then by generalizing the
method of continuation developed by \cite{Hu-Peng1995,Yong1997,Peng-Wu1999} for
differential equations, we have established the well-posedness of FBVIEs.The
key is to apply the chain rule to the mapping $t\mapsto\big[\int_\cdot^T\langle
Y(s,s),X(s,\cdot)\rangle ds +\langle G(X(T,T)),X(T,\cdot)\rangle\big](t)$.

one-dimensional hyperbolic partial differential equations. In the case of shock
waves the main challenge is addressed by developing a numerical method to
compute the evolution of the generalized tangent vector introduced by Bressan
and Marson (1995). Our basic strategy is to combine the conservative numerical
schemes and a novel expression of the interface conditions for the tangent
vectors along the discontinuity. Based on this, we propose a simple numerical
method to compute the tangent vectors for general hyperbolic systems. Numerical
results are presented for Burgers' equation and a 2 x 2 hyperbolic system with
two genuinely nonlinear fields.

                                        <span>  Gateway will represent a primary logistic infrastructure in cislunar space.
The identification of efficient orbit transfers capable of connecting Earth,
Moon, and Gateway paves the way for enabling refurbishment, servicing, and
utilization of this orbiting platform. This study is devoted to determining
two-way minimum-time low-thrust orbit transfers that connect both Earth and
Moon to Gateway. Backward time propagation is proposed as a very convenient
option for trajectories that approach and rendezvous with Gateway, and a
unified formulation is introduced for minimum-time orbit transfers, using
either forward or backward propagation. Two-way transfers between Gateway and a
specified low-altitude lunar orbit are first determined, using an indirect
heuristic method, which employs the necessary conditions for optimality and a
heuristic algorithm. Second, two-way orbit transfers that connect Earth and
Gateway are addressed. Because these trajectories exist under the influence of
two major attracting bodies, the underlying optimal control problem is
formulated as a multi-arc trajectory optimization problem, involving three
different representations for the spacecraft state. Multi-arc optimal control
problems are associated with several corner conditions to be enforced at the
junction time that separates distinct arcs. However, these conditions are shown
to be solvable sequentially for the problem at hand, leveraging implicit
costate transformation. This implies that the multi-arc problem has a set of
unknown quantities with the same size as that of a single-arc optimal control
problem, with apparent advantages of computational nature. The indirect
heuristic method is also applied in this second mission scenario.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we address a nonconvexly constrained nonsmooth optimization
problem involving the composition of a weakly convex function and a smooth
mapping. To find a stationary point of the target problem, we propose a
variable smoothing-type algorithm by combining the ideas of (i) translating the
constrained problem into a Euclidean optimization problem with a smooth
parametrization of the constraint set; (ii) exploiting a sequence of smoothed
surrogate functions, of the cost function, given with the Moreau envelope of a
weakly convex function. The proposed algorithm produces a vector sequence by
the gradient descent update of a smoothed surrogate function at each iteration.
In a case where the proximity operator of the weakly convex function is
available, the proposed algorithm does not require any iterative solver for
subproblems therein. By leveraging tools in the variational analysis, we show
the so-called {\em gradient consistency property}, which is a key ingredient
for smoothing-type algorithms, of the smoothed surrogate function used in this
paper. Based on the gradient consistency property, we also establish an
asymptotic convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm. Numerical
experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

                                        <span>  In this paper, stability and sensitivity properties of a class of parametric
constrained optimization problem, whose feasible region is defined by a
set-valued inclusion, are investigated through the associated optimal value
function. Set-valued inclusions are a kind of constraint system, which
naturally emerges in contexts requiring the robust fulfilment of traditional
cone constraints, where data are affected by uncertain elements having a non
stochastic nature, or in (MPEC) as a vector equilibrium constraint, where
feasible solutions are intended as equilibrium point in a strong sense. Under
proper convexity assumptions on the objective function and the constraining
set-valued term, combined with a global qualification condition, a class of
parametric optimization problems is singled out, which displays a global
Lipschitz behaviour. By employing recent results of variational analysis,
elements for a sensitivity analysis of this class of problems are provided via
exact subgradient formulae for the optimal value function. Further consequences
of the stability behaviour are explored in terms of problem calmness and
viability of penalization techniques.

                                        <span>  Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to a variety of
robotics applications, where it outperforms classical methods. However, the
safety aspect of RL and the transfer to the real world remain an open
challenge. A prominent field for tackling this challenge and ensuring the
safety of the agents during training and execution is safe reinforcement
learning. Safe RL can be achieved through constrained RL and safe exploration
approaches. The former learns the safety constraints over the course of
training to achieve a safe behavior by the end of training, at the cost of high
number of collisions at earlier stages of the training. The latter offers
robust safety by enforcing the safety constraints as hard constraints, which
prevents collisions but hinders the exploration of the RL agent, resulting in
lower rewards and poor performance. To overcome those drawbacks, we propose a
novel safety shield, that combines the robustness of the optimization-based
controllers with the long prediction capabilities of the RL agents, allowing
the RL agent to adaptively tune the parameters of the controller. Our approach
is able to improve the exploration of the RL agents for navigation tasks, while
minimizing the number of collisions. Experiments in simulation show that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in the reached
goals-to-collisions ratio in different challenging environments. The
goals-to-collisions ratio metrics emphasizes the importance of minimizing the
number of collisions, while learning to accomplish the task. Our approach
achieves a higher number of reached goals compared to the classic safety
shields and fewer collisions compared to constrained RL approaches. Finally, we
demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in a real-world experiment.

                                        <span>  When deploying autonomous systems in unknown and changing environments, it is
critical that their motion planning and control algorithms are computationally
efficient and can be reapplied online in real time, whilst providing
theoretical safety guarantees in the presence of disturbances. The satisfaction
of these objectives becomes more challenging when considering time-varying
dynamics and disturbances, which arise in real-world contexts. We develop
methods with the potential to address these issues by applying an
offline-computed safety guaranteeing controller on a physical system, to track
a virtual system that evolves through a trajectory that is replanned online,
accounting for constraints updated online. The first method we propose is
designed for general time-varying systems over a finite horizon. Our second
method overcomes the finite horizon restriction for periodic systems. We
simulate our algorithms on a case study of an autonomous underwater vehicle
subject to wave disturbances.

constraints, where only the gradient information of the objective and the
bandit feedback of constraint functions are observed. We propose a safe and
efficient Lyapunov-optimization algorithm (SELO) that can achieve an
$O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and zero cumulative constraint violation. The result also
implies SELO achieves $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret when the budget is hard and not
allowed to be violated. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient as
it resembles a primal-dual algorithm where the primal problem is an
unconstrained, strongly convex and smooth problem, and the dual problem has a
simple gradient-type update. The algorithm and theory are further justified in
a simulated application of energy-efficient task processing in distributed data
centers.

coefficient in the principal part of the state equation. The state equation, in
addition, is parameter dependent, and we allow it to change type in the limit
of this (modeling) parameter. We develop a framework that guarantees asymptotic
compatibility, that is unconditional convergence with respect to modeling and
discretization parameters to the solution of the corresponding limiting
problems. This framework is then applied to two distinct classes of problems
where the modeling parameter represents the degree of nonlocality.
Specifically, we show unconditional convergence of optimal design problems when
the state equation is either a scalar-valued fractional equation, or a strongly
coupled system of nonlocal equations derived from the bond-based model of
peridynamics.

structured optimization problems wherein the variables must belong to some
basic set, the feasible domain is described by the intersection of a large
number of functional constraints and the objective stems as the pointwise
minimum of a collection of functional pieces. Among others, this setting
includes all non-convex piecewise linear problems. The global minimum of a
minimum structured problem can be computed using a simple enumeration scheme by
solving a sequence of individual problems involving each a single piece and
then taking the smallest individual minimum.
  We propose a new algorithm, called Upper-Lower Optimization (ULO), tackling
problems from the aforementioned class. Our method does not require the
solution of every individual problem listed in the baseline enumeration scheme,
yielding potential substantial computational gains. It alternates between (a)
local-search steps, which minimize upper models, and (b) suggestion steps,
which optimize lower models. We prove that ULO can return a solution of any
prescribed global optimality accuracy. According to a computational complexity
model based on the cost of solving the individual problems, we analyze in which
practical scenarios ULO is expected to outperform the baseline enumeration
scheme. Finally, we empirically validate our approach on a set of piecewise

strategy for traffic networks under a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV)
environment. The proposed strategy requires CAVs, especially those with long
remaining travel distances, to temporarily wait at nearby parking facilities
when the network is congested. After a designated holding time, these CAVs are
allowed to re-enter the network. Doing so helps reduce congestion and improve
overall operational efficiency. Unlike traditional perimeter control approaches
that restrict inflows to congested regions, the proposed holding strategy
leverages existing parking infrastructure to temporarily hold vehicles in a way
that partially avoids local queue accumulation issues. The proposed method can
be easily integrated with existing signal control methods and retains the
maximum stability property of the original traffic signal control methods.
Simulation results show that the proposed strategy not only reduces travel time
for vehicles that are not held, but can also reduce travel times for some of
the held vehicles as well, which serves as another key merit of the proposed
approach. Compared to the two benchmark perimeter control algorithms, the
proposed strategy is more robust against demand patterns and generates stronger
improvements in the operational efficiency. Importantly, since the proposed
strategy requires existing parking infrastructure, its performance has been
demonstrated under various configurations of parking locations and capacities.
Lastly, the proposed strategy is shown to be beneficial in a partial CAV
environment where only a subset of vehicles are available for holding.

                                        <span>  Distributed learning algorithms, such as the ones employed in Federated
Learning (FL), require communication compression to reduce the cost of client
uploads. The compression methods used in practice are often biased, which
require error feedback to achieve convergence when the compression is
aggressive. In turn, error feedback requires client-specific control variates,
which directly contradicts privacy-preserving principles and requires stateful
clients. In this paper, we propose Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), a
novel distributed learning framework that allows highly compressible client
updates by exploiting past aggregated updates, and does not require control
variates. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative
algorithm and provide a theoretical proof of CAFe's superiority to Distributed
Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-smooth
regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. Experimental results confirm that
CAFe consistently outperforms distributed learning with direct compression and
highlight the compressibility of the client updates with CAFe.

                                        <span>  The value of second-order methods lies in the use of curvature information.
Yet, this information is costly to extract and once obtained, valuable negative
curvature information is often discarded so that the method is globally
convergent. This limits the effectiveness of second-order methods in modern
machine learning. In this paper, we show that second-order and
second-order-like methods are promising optimizers for neural networks provided
that we add one ingredient: negative step sizes. We show that under very
general conditions, methods that produce ascent directions are globally
convergent when combined with a Wolfe line search that allows both positive and
negative step sizes. We experimentally demonstrate that using negative step
sizes is often more effective than common Hessian modification methods.

infinite-horizon entropy-regularised Markov decision processes with Polish
state and action space. The flow is a continuous-time analogue of a policy
mirror descent method. We establish the global well-posedness of the gradient
flow and demonstrate its exponential convergence to the optimal policy.
Moreover, we prove the flow is stable with respect to gradient evaluation,
offering insights into the performance of a natural policy gradient flow with
log-linear policy parameterisation. To overcome challenges stemming from the
lack of the convexity of the objective function and the discontinuity arising
from the entropy regulariser, we leverage the performance difference lemma and
the duality relationship between the gradient and mirror descent flows. Our
analysis provides a theoretical foundation for developing various discrete
policy gradient algorithms.

method that solves large-scale linear least-squares problems with bound
constraints on the variables. The problem is solved by creating a series of
small problems of increasing size by projecting onto the basis of residuals.
Each projected problem is solved by the active-set method for convex quadratic
programming, warm-started with a working set and solution from the previous
problem. The method coincides with conjugate gradients (CG) or, equivalently,
LSQR when none of the constraints is active. When only a few constraints are
active the method converges, after a few initial iterations, like CG and LSQR.
An analysis links the convergence to an asymptotic Krylov subspace. We also
present an efficient implementation where QR factorizations of the projected
problems are updated over the inner iterations and Cholesky or Gram-Schmidt
over the outer iterations.

arise in control of continua (ensembles) of linear hyperbolic PDEs and which
can approximate backstepping kernels arising in control of a large-scale, PDE
system counterpart (with computational complexity that does not grow with the
number of state components of the large-scale system). In the first method, we
provide explicit formulae for the solution to the continuum kernels PDEs,
employing a (triple) power series representation of the continuum kernel and
establishing its convergence properties. In this case, we also provide means
for reducing computational complexity by properly truncating the power series
(in the powers of the ensemble variable). In the second method, we identify a
class of systems for which the solution to the continuum (and hence, also an
approximate solution to the respective large-scale) kernel equations can be
constructed in closed form. We also present numerical examples to illustrate
computational efficiency/accuracy of the approaches, as well as to validate the
stabilization properties of the approximate control kernels, constructed based
on the continuum.

                                        <span>  We investigate optimality conditions for the sensor placement problem within
optimal experimental design, wherein one must decide on the optimal manner in
which a fixed number of sensors can be arranged over a large number of
candidate locations. By a subgradient argument, we obtain sufficient and
necessary conditions for global optimality of the relaxed problem, and
demonstrate how one can take advantage of this optimality criterion to
approximate optimal binary designs, i.e.~designs where no fractions of sensors
are placed. To demonstrate our optimality criteria-based results, we derive a
trace-free, efficient formulation of the gradient of the A-optimal objective
for finite element-discretised function space settings, and study globally
optimal designs for a Helmholtz-type source problem and extensions towards
optimal binary designs.

oracle model, i.e., when the deterministic problem is solved by an oracle. The
oracle-based setup is favorable in many situations, e.g., when a compact
formulation of the feasible region is unknown or does not exist. We propose an
iterative method based on a Frank-Wolfe type algorithm applied to a smoothed

several previous efforts from the literature, attains the best known oracle
complexity for the problem and performs better than state-of-the-art on
high-dimensional problem instances, in particular for larger uncertainty sets.

stochastic systems using infinitesimal generator learning within
infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Our learning framework
leverages data samples of system dynamics and stage cost functions, with only
control penalties and constraints provided. The proposed method directly learns
the diffusion operator of a controlled Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation in an
infinite-dimensional hypothesis space. This operator models the continuous-time
evolution of the probability measure of the control system's state. We
demonstrate that this approach seamlessly integrates with modern convex
operator-theoretic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman recursions, enabling a data-driven
solution to the optimal control problem. Furthermore, our statistical learning
framework includes nonparametric estimators for uncontrolled forward
infinitesimal generators as a special case. Numerical experiments, ranging from
synthetic differential equations to simulated robotic systems, showcase the
advantages of our approach compared to both modern data-driven and classical
nonlinear programming methods for optimal control.

                                        <span>  Given a set of measurements, observability characterizes the
distinguishability of a system's initial state, whereas constructability
focuses on the final state in a trajectory. In the presence of process and/or
measurement noise, the Fisher information matrices with respect to the initial
and final states$\unicode{x2013}$equivalent to the stochastic observability and
constructability Gramians$\unicode{x2013}$bound the performance of
corresponding estimators through the Cram\'er-Rao inequality. This letter
establishes a connection between stochastic observability and constructability
of discrete-time linear systems and provides a more numerically stable way for
calculating the stochastic observability Gramian. We define a dual system and
show that the dual system's stochastic constructability is equivalent to the
original system's stochastic observability, and vice versa. This duality
enables the interchange of theorems and tools for observability and
constructability. For example, we use this result to translate an existing
recursive formula for the stochastic constructability Gramian into a formula
for recursively calculating the stochastic observability Gramian for both
time-varying and time-invariant systems, and we show the convergence of this
sequence for the latter. Finally, we illustrate the robustness of our formula
compared to existing (non-recursive) formulas through a numerical example.

novel iterative algorithm named EXtremum-seeking Policy iteration LQR
(EXP-LQR). The peculiarity of EXP-LQR is that it only needs access to a
truncated approximation of the infinite-horizon cost associated to a given
policy. Hence, EXP-LQR does not need the direct knowledge of neither the system
matrices, cost matrices, and state measurements. In particular, at each
iteration, EXP-LQR refines the maintained policy using a truncated LQR cost
retrieved by performing finite-time virtual or real experiments in which a
perturbed version of the current policy is employed. Such a perturbation is
done according to an extremum-seeking mechanism and makes the overall algorithm
a time-varying nonlinear system. By using a Lyapunov-based approach exploiting
averaging theory, we show that EXP-LQR exponentially converges to an
arbitrarily small neighborhood of the optimal gain matrix. We corroborate the
theoretical results with numerical simulations involving the control of an
induction motor.

                                        <span>  A fault diagnosis with commendable accuracy is essential for the reliability
of industrial machines. Two main challenges affect the design of
high-performing intelligent systems: (i) the selection of a suitable model and
(ii) domain adaptation if there is a continuous change in operating conditions.
Therefore, we propose an evolutionary Net2Net transformation (EvoN2N) that
finds the best suitable DNN architecture with limited availability of labeled
data samples. Net2Net transformation-based quick learning algorithm has been
used in the evolutionary framework of Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm
II to obtain the best DNN architecture. Net2Net transformation-based quick
learning algorithm uses the concept of knowledge transfer from one generation
to the next for faster fitness evaluation. The proposed framework can obtain
the best model for intelligent fault diagnosis without a long and
time-consuming search process. The proposed framework has been validated on the
Case Western Reserve University dataset, the Paderborn University dataset, and
the gearbox fault detection dataset under different operating conditions. The
best models obtained are capable of demonstrating an excellent diagnostic
performance and classification accuracy of almost up to 100\% for most of the
operating conditions.

                                        <span>  We consider an $N$-player game where the players control the drifts of their
diffusive states which have no interaction in the noise terms. The aim of each
player is to minimize the expected value of her cost, which is a function of
the player's state and the empirical measure of the states of all the players.
Our aim is to determine the $N \to \infty$ asymptotic behavior of the upper
order statistics of the player's states under Nash equilibrium (the Nash
states). For this purpose, we consider also a system of interacting diffusions
which is constructed by using the Master PDE of the game and approximates the
system of the Nash states, and we improve an $L^2$ estimate for the distance
between the drifts of the two systems which has been used for establishing
Central Limit Theorems and Large Deviations Principles for the Nash states in
the past. By differentiating the Master PDE, we obtain that estimate also in
$L^{\infty}$, which allows us to control the Radon-Nikodym derivative of a
Girsanov transformation that connects the two systems. The latter allows us to
reduce the problem to the case of $N$ uncontrolled diffusions with standard
mean-field interaction in the drifts, which has been treated in a previous
work.

                                        <span>  Focusing on stochastic programming (SP) with covariate information, this
paper proposes an empirical risk minimization (ERM) method embedded within a
nonconvex piecewise affine decision rule (PADR), which aims to learn the direct
mapping from features to optimal decisions. We establish the nonasymptotic
consistency result of our PADR-based ERM model for unconstrained problems and
asymptotic consistency result for constrained ones. To solve the nonconvex and
nondifferentiable ERM problem, we develop an enhanced stochastic
majorization-minimization algorithm and establish the asymptotic convergence to
(composite strong) directional stationarity along with complexity analysis. We
show that the proposed PADR-based ERM method applies to a broad class of
nonconvex SP problems with theoretical consistency guarantees and computational
tractability. Our numerical study demonstrates the superior performance of
PADR-based ERM methods compared to state-of-the-art approaches under various
settings, with significantly lower costs, less computation time, and robustness
to feature dimensions and nonlinearity of the underlying dependency.

                                        <span>  Learning to optimize is an approach that leverages training data to
accelerate the solution of optimization problems. Many approaches use unrolling
to parametrize the update step and learn optimal parameters. Although L2O has
shown empirical advantages over classical optimization algorithms, memory
restrictions often greatly limit the unroll length and learned algorithms
usually do not provide convergence guarantees. In contrast, we introduce a
novel method employing a greedy strategy that learns iteration-specific
parameters by minimizing the function value at the next iteration. This enables
training over significantly more iterations while maintaining constant GPU
memory usage. We parameterize the update such that parameter learning
corresponds to solving a convex optimization problem at each iteration. In
particular, we explore preconditioned gradient descent with multiple
parametrizations including a novel convolutional preconditioner. With our
learned algorithm, convergence in the training set is proved even when the
preconditioner is neither symmetric nor positive definite. Convergence on a
class of unseen functions is also obtained, ensuring robust performance and
generalization beyond the training data. We test our learned algorithms on two
inverse problems, image deblurring and Computed Tomography, on which learned
convolutional preconditioners demonstrate improved empirical performance over
classical optimization algorithms such as Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient
Method and the quasi-Newton method L-BFGS.

under temporal constraints are developed in the framework of tropical algebra
which deals with the theory and application of algebraic systems with
idempotent operations. We start with a constrained tropical optimization
problem that has an objective function represented as a vector form given by an
arbitrary matrix, and that can be solved analytically in a closed but somewhat
complicated form. We examine a special case of the problem when the objective
function is given by a matrix of unit rank, and show that the solution can be
sufficiently refined in this case, which results in an essentially simplified
analytical form and reduced computational complexity of the solution. We
exploit the obtained result to find complete solutions of project scheduling
problems to minimize the project makespan and the maximum absolute deviation of
start times of activities under temporal constraints. The constraints under
consideration include ``start--start'', ``start--finish'' and ``finish--start''
precedence relations, release times, release deadlines and completion deadlines
for activities. As an application, we consider optimal scheduling problems of a
vaccination project in a medical centre.

differential games rapidly become intractable, making the design of safe
autonomous agents challenging in complex or team settings. Deep-learning
approaches avoid discretization and yield numerous successes in robotics and
autonomy, but at a higher dimensional limit, accuracy falls as sampling becomes
less efficient. We propose using rapidly generated linear solutions to the
partial differential equation (PDE) arising in the problem to accelerate and
improve learned value functions for guidance in high-dimensional, nonlinear
problems. We define two programs that combine supervision of the linear
solution with a standard PDE loss. We demonstrate that these programs offer
improvements in speed and accuracy in both a 50-D differential game problem and
a 10-D quadrotor control problem.

                                        <span>  Decentralized stochastic control problems are intrinsically difficult to
study because of the inapplicability of standard tools from centralized control
such as dynamic programming and the resulting computational complexity. In this
paper, we address some of these challenges for decentralized stochastic control
with Borel spaces under three different but tightly related information
structures under a unified theme: the one-step delayed information sharing
pattern, the K-step periodic information sharing pattern, and the completely
decentralized information structure where no sharing of information occurs. We
will show that the one-step delayed and K-step periodic problems can be reduced
to a centralized MDP, generalizing prior results which considered finite,
linear, or static models, by addressing several measurability questions. The
separated nature of policies under both information structures is then
established. We then provide sufficient conditions for the transition kernels
of both centralized reductions to be weak-Feller, which facilitates rigorous
approximation and learning theoretic results. We will then show that for the
completely decentralized control problem finite memory local policies are near
optimal under a joint conditional mixing condition. This is achieved by
obtaining a bound for finite memory policies which goes to zero as memory size
increases. We will also provide a performance bound for the K-periodic problem,
which results from replacing the full common information by a finite sliding
window of information. The latter will depend on the condition of predictor
stability in expected total variation, which we will establish. We finally show
that under the periodic information sharing pattern, a quantized Q-learning
algorithm converges asymptotically towards a near optimal solution. Each of the
above, to our knowledge, is a new contribution to the literature.

as witnesses of fundamental limitations, optimality certificates, or

our approach by designing certifiably near-optimal controllers for a qubit in a
cavity subjected to photon counting and homodyne detection measurements.

nature, and so network-valued data are ubiquitous in the real world. The "space
of networks", however, has a complex structure that cannot be adequately
described using conventional statistical tools. We introduce a
measure-theoretic formalism for modeling generalized network structures such as
graphs, hypergraphs, or graphs whose nodes come with a partition into
categorical classes. We then propose a metric that extends the
Gromov-Wasserstein distance between graphs and the co-optimal transport
distance between hypergraphs. We characterize the geometry of this space,
thereby providing a unified theoretical treatment of generalized networks that
encompasses the cases of pairwise, as well as higher-order, relations. In
particular, we show that our metric is an Alexandrov space of non-negative
curvature, and leverage this structure to define gradients for certain
functionals commonly arising in geometric data analysis tasks. We extend our
analysis to the setting where vertices have additional label information, and
derive efficient computational schemes to use in practice. Equipped with these
theoretical and computational tools, we demonstrate the utility of our
framework in a suite of applications, including hypergraph alignment,
clustering and dictionary learning from ensemble data, multi-omics alignment,
as well as multiscale network alignment.

                                        <span>  We propose a new operator-sketching paradigm for designing efficient
iterative data-driven reconstruction (IDR) schemes, e.g. Plug-and-Play
algorithms and deep unrolling networks. These IDR schemes are currently the
state-of-the-art solutions for imaging inverse problems. However, for
high-dimensional imaging tasks, especially X-ray CT and MRI imaging, these IDR
schemes typically become inefficient both in terms of computation, due to the
need of computing multiple times the high-dimensional forward and adjoint
operators. In this work, we explore and propose a universal dimensionality
reduction framework for accelerating IDR schemes in solving imaging inverse
problems, based on leveraging the sketching techniques from stochastic
optimization. Using this framework, we derive a number of accelerated IDR
schemes, such as the plug-and-play multi-stage sketched gradient (PnP-MS2G) and
sketching-based primal-dual (LSPD and Sk-LSPD) deep unrolling networks.
Meanwhile, for fully accelerating PnP schemes when the denoisers are
computationally expensive, we provide novel stochastic lazy denoising schemes
(Lazy-PnP and Lazy-PnP-EQ), leveraging the ProxSkip scheme in optimization and
equivariant image denoisers, which can massively accelerate the PnP algorithms
with improved practicality. We provide theoretical analysis for recovery
guarantees of instances of the proposed framework. Our numerical experiments on
natural image processing and tomographic image reconstruction demonstrate the
remarkable effectiveness of our sketched IDR schemes.

                                        <span>  3D situational awareness is critical for any autonomous system. However, when
operating underwater, environmental conditions often dictate the use of
acoustic sensors. These acoustic sensors are plagued by high noise and a lack
of 3D information in sonar imagery, motivating the use of an orthogonal pair of
imaging sonars to recover 3D perceptual data. Thus far, mapping systems in this
area only use a subset of the available data at discrete timesteps and rely on
object-level prior information in the environment to develop high-coverage 3D
maps. Moreover, simple repeating objects must be present to build high-coverage
maps. In this work, we propose a submap-based mapping system integrated with a
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system to produce dense, 3D maps
of complex unknown environments with varying densities of simple repeating
objects. We compare this submapping approach to our previous works in this
area, analyzing simple and highly complex environments, such as submerged
aircraft. We analyze the tradeoffs between a submapping-based approach and our
previous work leveraging simple repeating objects. We show where each method is
well-motivated and where they fall short. Importantly, our proposed use of
submapping achieves an advance in underwater situational awareness with wide
aperture multi-beam imaging sonar, moving toward generalized large-scale dense
3D mapping capability for fully unknown complex environments.

We introduce a Navigation World Model (NWM), a controllable video generation
model that predicts future visual observations based on past observations and
navigation actions. To capture complex environment dynamics, NWM employs a
Conditional Diffusion Transformer (CDiT), trained on a diverse collection of
egocentric videos of both human and robotic agents, and scaled up to 1 billion
parameters. In familiar environments, NWM can plan navigation trajectories by
simulating them and evaluating whether they achieve the desired goal. Unlike
supervised navigation policies with fixed behavior, NWM can dynamically
incorporate constraints during planning. Experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in planning trajectories from scratch or by ranking trajectories
sampled from an external policy. Furthermore, NWM leverages its learned visual
priors to imagine trajectories in unfamiliar environments from a single input
image, making it a flexible and powerful tool for next-generation navigation
systems.

the contact around it, manual inspection approaches of aeroengines through the
inspection ports have unreachable areas, and it's difficult to traverse
multistage blades and inspect them simultaneously, which requires engine
disassembly or the cooperation of multiple operators, resulting in efficiency
decline and increased costs. To this end, this paper proposes a novel continuum
manipulator with push-pull multisection structure which provides a potential
solution for the disadvantages mentioned above due to its higher flexibility,
passability, and controllability in confined spaces. The ultra-slender design
combined with a tendon-driven mechanism makes the manipulator acquire enough
workspace and more flexible postures while maintaining a light weight.
Considering the coupling between the tendons in multisection, a innovative
kinematics decoupling control method is implemented, which can realize
real-time control in the case of limited computational resources. A prototype
is built to validate the capabilities of mechatronic design and the performance
of the control algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages
of our continuum manipulator in the in-situ inspection of aeroengines'
multistage blades, which has the potential to be a replacement solution for
industrial endoscopes.

feet are currently in contact with the ground so as to avoid improper control
actions that could jeopardize the stability of the robot. Additionally, modern
algorithms for estimating the position and orientation of a robot's base frame
rely heavily on such contact mode estimates. Dedicated contact sensors on the
feet can be used to estimate this contact mode, but these sensors are prone to
noise, time delays, damage/yielding from repeated impacts with the ground, and
are not available on every robot. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
momentum observer based method for contact mode estimation that does not rely
on such contact sensors. Often, momentum observers assume that the robot's base
frame can be treated as an inertial frame. However, since many humanoids' legs
represent a significant portion of the overall mass, the proposed method
instead utilizes multiple simultaneous dynamic models. Each of these models
assumes a different contact condition. A given contact assumption is then used
to constrain the full dynamics in order to avoid assuming that either the body
is an inertial frame or that a fully accurate estimate of body velocity is
known. The (dis)agreement between each model's estimates and measurements is
used to determine which contact mode is most likely using a Markov-style fusion
method. The proposed method produces contact detection accuracy of up to 98.44%
with a low noise simulation and 77.12% when utilizing data collect on the
Sarcos Guardian XO robot (a hybrid humanoid/exoskeleton).

                                        <span>  Path Planning methods for autonomously controlling swarms of unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) are gaining momentum due to their operational advantages. An
increasing number of scenarios now require autonomous control of multiple UAVs,
as autonomous operation can significantly reduce labor costs. Additionally,
obtaining optimal flight paths can lower energy consumption, thereby extending
battery life for other critical operations. Many of these scenarios, however,
involve obstacles such as power lines and trees, which complicate Path
Planning. This paper presents an evolutionary computation-based system
employing genetic algorithms to address this problem in environments with
obstacles. The proposed approach aims to ensure complete coverage of areas with
fixed obstacles, such as in field exploration tasks, while minimizing flight
time regardless of map size or the number of UAVs in the swarm. No specific
goal points or prior information beyond the provided map is required. The
experiments conducted in this study used five maps of varying sizes and
obstacle densities, as well as a control map without obstacles, with different
numbers of UAVs. The results demonstrate that this method can determine optimal
paths for all UAVs during full map traversal, thus minimizing resource
consumption. A comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art approach is
presented to highlight the advantages and potential limitations of the proposed
method.

capabilities of multi-robot systems in challenging manufacturing processes.
However, the path tracking accuracy of physically coupled robots is not studied
adequately, especially considering the uncertain kinematic parameters, the
mechanical elasticity, and the built-in controllers of off-the-shelf robots.
This paper addresses these issues with a novel differential-algebraic system
model which is verified against measurement data from real execution. The
uncertain kinematic parameters are estimated online to adapt the model.
Consequently, an adaptive model predictive controller is designed as a
coordinator between the robots. The controller achieves a path tracking error
reduction of 88.6% compared to the state-of-the-art benchmark in the
simulation.

                                        <span>  Physical movement therapy is a crucial method of rehabilitation aimed at
reinstating mobility among patients facing motor dysfunction due to
neurological conditions or accidents. Such therapy is usually featured as
patient-specific, repetitive, and labor-intensive. The conventional method,
where therapists collaborate with patients to conduct repetitive physical
training, proves strenuous due to these characteristics. The concept of
robot-assisted rehabilitation, assisting therapists with robotic systems, has
gained substantial popularity. However, building such systems presents
challenges, such as diverse task demands, uncertainties in dynamic models, and
safety issues. To address these concerns, in this paper, we proposed a
bilateral teleoperation system for rehabilitation. The control scheme of the
system is designed as an integrated framework of impedance control and
disturbance observer where the former can ensure compliant human-robot
interaction without the need for force sensors while the latter can compensate
for dynamic uncertainties when only a roughly identified dynamic model is
available. Furthermore, the scheme allows free switching between tracking tasks
and physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). The presented system can execute a
wide array of pre-defined trajectories with varying patterns, adaptable to
diverse needs. Moreover, the system can capture therapists' demonstrations,
replaying them as many times as necessary. The effectiveness of the
teleoperation system is experimentally evaluated and demonstrated.

                                        <span>  Legged robots possess inherent advantages in traversing complex 3D terrains.
However, previous work on low-cost quadruped robots with egocentric vision
systems has been limited by a narrow front-facing view and exteroceptive noise,
restricting omnidirectional mobility in such environments. While building a
voxel map through a hierarchical structure can refine exteroception processing,
it introduces significant computational overhead, noise, and delays. In this
paper, we present MOVE, a one-stage end-to-end learning framework capable of
multi-skill omnidirectional legged locomotion with limited view in 3D
environments, just like what a real animal can do. When movement aligns with
the robot's line of sight, exteroceptive perception enhances locomotion,
enabling extreme climbing and leaping. When vision is obstructed or the
direction of movement lies outside the robot's field of view, the robot relies
on proprioception for tasks like crawling and climbing stairs. We integrate all
these skills into a single neural network by introducing a pseudo-siamese
network structure combining supervised and contrastive learning which helps the
robot infer its surroundings beyond its field of view. Experiments in both
simulations and real-world scenarios demonstrate the robustness of our method,
broadening the operational environments for robotics with egocentric vision.

is a lack of understanding of how consistently emotions can be conveyed to
robots through touch. This study explores the consistency of touch-based
emotional expression toward a robot by integrating tactile and auditory sensory
reading of affective haptic expressions. We developed a piezoresistive pressure
sensor and used a microphone to mimic touch and sound channels, respectively.
In a study with 28 participants, each conveyed 10 emotions to a robot using
spontaneous touch gestures. Our findings reveal a statistically significant
consistency in emotion expression among participants. However, some emotions
obtained low intraclass correlation values. Additionally, certain emotions with
similar levels of arousal or valence did not exhibit significant differences in
the way they were conveyed. We subsequently constructed a multi-modal
integrating touch and audio features to decode the 10 emotions. A support
vector machine (SVM) model demonstrated the highest accuracy, achieving 40% for
10 classes, with "Attention" being the most accurately conveyed emotion at a
balanced accuracy of 87.65%.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we present DiffusionVLA, a novel framework that seamlessly
combines the autoregression model with the diffusion model for learning
visuomotor policy. Central to our approach is a next-token prediction
objective, enabling the model to reason effectively over the user's query in
the context of current observations. Subsequently, a diffusion model is
attached to generate robust action outputs. To enhance policy learning through
self-reasoning, we introduce a novel reasoning injection module that integrates
reasoning phrases directly into the policy learning process. The whole
framework is simple and flexible, making it easy to deploy and upgrade. We
conduct extensive experiments using multiple real robots to validate the
effectiveness of DiffusionVLA. Our tests include a challenging factory sorting
task, where DiffusionVLA successfully categorizes objects, including those not
seen during training. We observe that the reasoning module makes the model
interpretable. It allows observers to understand the model thought process and
identify potential causes of policy failures. Additionally, we test
DiffusionVLA on a zero-shot bin-picking task, achieving 63.7\% accuracy on 102
previously unseen objects. Our method demonstrates robustness to visual
changes, such as distractors and new backgrounds, and easily adapts to new
embodiments. Furthermore, DiffusionVLA can follow novel instructions and retain
conversational ability. Notably, DiffusionVLA is data-efficient and fast at
inference; our smallest DiffusionVLA-2B runs 82Hz on a single A6000 GPU and can
train from scratch on less than 50 demonstrations for a complex task. Finally,
we scale the model from 2B to 72B parameters, showcasing improved
generalization capabilities with increased model size.

                                        <span>  The development of robotic grippers and hands for automation aims to emulate
human dexterity without sacrificing the efficiency of industrial grippers. This
study introduces Rotograb, a tendon-actuated robotic hand featuring a novel
rotating thumb. The aim is to combine the dexterity of human hands with the
efficiency of industrial grippers. The rotating thumb enlarges the workspace
and allows in-hand manipulation. A novel joint design minimizes movement
interference and simplifies kinematics, using a cutout for tendon routing. We
integrate teleoperation, using a depth camera for real-time tracking and
autonomous manipulation powered by reinforcement learning with proximal policy
optimization. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Rotograb's rotating
thumb greatly improves both operational versatility and workspace. It can
handle various grasping and manipulation tasks with objects from the YCB
dataset, with particularly good results when rotating objects within its grasp.
Rotograb represents a notable step towards bridging the capability gap between
human hands and industrial grippers. The tendon-routing and thumb-rotating
mechanisms allow for a new level of control and dexterity. Integrating
teleoperation and autonomous learning underscores Rotograb's adaptability and
sophistication, promising substantial advancements in both robotics research
and practical applications.

                                        <span>  Navigating outdoor environments with visual Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM) systems poses significant challenges due to dynamic scenes,
lighting variations, and seasonal changes, requiring robust solutions. While
traditional SLAM methods struggle with adaptability, deep learning-based
approaches and emerging neural radiance fields as well as Gaussian
Splatting-based SLAM methods, offer promising alternatives. However, these
methods have primarily been evaluated in controlled indoor environments with
stable conditions, leaving a gap in understanding their performance in
unstructured and variable outdoor settings. This study addresses this gap by
evaluating these methods in natural outdoor environments, focusing on camera
tracking accuracy, robustness to environmental factors, and computational
efficiency, highlighting distinct trade-offs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that neural SLAM methods achieve superior robustness, particularly under
challenging conditions such as low light, but at a high computational cost. At
the same time, traditional methods perform the best across seasons but are
highly sensitive to variations in lighting conditions. The code of the
benchmark is publicly available at

robotics, offering a wide range of scientific and industrial applications.
Among the proposed approaches, airflow stands out for its ability to project
across considerable distances and its flexibility in actuating objects of
varying materials, sizes, and shapes. However, predicting airflow fields at a
distance, as well as the motion of objects within them, remains notoriously
challenging due to their nonlinear and stochastic nature. Here, we propose a
model-based learning approach using a jet-induced airflow field for remote
multi-object manipulation on a surface. Our approach incorporates an analytical
model of the field, learned object dynamics, and a model-based controller. The
model predicts an air velocity field over an infinite surface for a specified
jet orientation, while the object dynamics are learned through a robust system
identification algorithm. Using the model-based controller, we can
automatically and remotely, at meter-scale distances, control the motion of
single and multiple objects for different tasks, such as path-following,
aggregating, and sorting.

shortage of training data, even with a simple change in speed. Although the
field of data augmentation has addressed the lack of data, conventional methods
of data augmentation for robot manipulation are limited to simulation-based
methods or downsampling for position control. This paper proposes a novel
method of data augmentation that is applicable to force control and preserves
the advantages of real-world datasets. We applied teaching-playback at variable
speeds as real-world data augmentation to increase both the quantity and
quality of environmental reactions at variable speeds. An experiment was
conducted on bilateral control-based imitation learning using a method of
imitation learning equipped with position-force control. We evaluated the
effect of real-world data augmentation on two tasks, pick-and-place and wiping,
at variable speeds, each from two human demonstrations at fixed speed. The
results showed a maximum 55% increase in success rate from a simple change in
speed of real-world reactions and improved accuracy along the
duration/frequency command by gathering environmental reactions at variable
speeds.

presents the application of the MuJoCo physics engine to realize a digital twin
of an adaptive soft foot developed for use with legged robots. We release the
MuJoCo soft foot digital twin as open source to allow users and researchers to
explore new approaches to locomotion. The work includes the system modeling
techniques along with the kinematic and dynamic attributes involved. Validation
is conducted through a rigorous comparison with bench tests on a physical
prototype, replicating these experiments in simulation. Results are evaluated
based on sole deformation and contact forces during foot-obstacle interaction.
The foot model is subsequently integrated into simulations of the humanoid
robot COMAN+, replacing its original flat feet. Results show an improvement in
the robot's ability to negotiate small obstacles without altering its control
strategy. Ultimately, this study offers a comprehensive modeling approach for
adaptive soft feet, supported by qualitative comparisons of bipedal locomotion
with state of the art robotic feet.

                                        <span>  In autonomous navigation, trajectory replanning, refinement, and control
command generation are essential for effective motion planning. This paper
presents a resilient approach to trajectory replanning addressing scenarios
where the initial planner's solution becomes infeasible. The proposed method
incorporates a hybrid A* algorithm to generate feasible trajectories when the
primary planner fails and applies a soft constraints-based smoothing technique
to refine these trajectories, ensuring continuity, obstacle avoidance, and
kinematic feasibility. Obstacle constraints are modelled using a dynamic
Voronoi map to improve navigation through narrow passages. This approach
enhances the consistency of trajectory planning, speeds up convergence, and
meets real-time computational requirements. In environments with around 30\% or
higher obstacle density, the ratio of free space before and after placing new
obstacles, the Resilient Timed Elastic Band (RTEB) planner achieves
approximately 20\% reduction in traverse distance, traverse time, and control
effort compared to the Timed Elastic Band (TEB) planner and Nonlinear Model
Predictive Control (NMPC) planner. These improvements demonstrate the RTEB
planner's potential for application in field robotics, particularly in
agricultural and industrial environments, where navigating unstructured terrain
is crucial for ensuring efficiency and operational resilience.

construction, search and rescue and defence. Traditional on-road autonomous
methods struggle with dynamic terrains, leading to poor vehicle control on
off-road. Recent deep-learning models have used perception sensors along with
kinesthetic feedback for navigation on such terrains. However, this approach
has out-of-domain uncertainty. Factors like change in weather and time of day
impacts the performance of the model. We propose a multi modal fusion network
FuseIsPath capable of using LWIR and RGB images to provide robustness against
dynamic weather and light conditions. To aid further works in this domain, we
also open-source a day-night dataset with LWIR and RGB images along with
pseudo-labels for traversability. In order to co-register the two images we
developed a novel method for targetless extrinsic calibration of LWIR, LiDAR
and RGB cameras with translation accuracy of 1.7cm and rotation accuracy of
0.827degree.

                                        <span>  Making multi-camera visual SLAM systems easier to set up and more robust to
the environment is always one of the focuses of vision robots. Existing
monocular and binocular vision SLAM systems have narrow FoV and are fragile in
textureless environments with degenerated accuracy and limited robustness. Thus
multi-camera SLAM systems are gaining attention because they can provide
redundancy for texture degeneration with wide FoV. However, current
multi-camera SLAM systems face massive data processing pressure and elaborately
designed camera configurations, leading to estimation failures for arbitrarily
arranged multi-camera systems. To address these problems, we propose a generic
visual odometry for arbitrarily arranged multi-cameras, which can achieve
metric-scale state estimation with high flexibility in the cameras'
arrangement. Specifically, we first design a learning-based feature extraction
and tracking framework to shift the pressure of CPU processing of multiple
video streams. Then we use the rigid constraints between cameras to estimate
the metric scale poses for robust SLAM system initialization. Finally, we fuse
the features of the multi-cameras in the SLAM back-end to achieve robust pose
estimation and online scale optimization. Additionally, multi-camera features
help improve the loop detection for pose graph optimization. Experiments on
KITTI-360 and MultiCamData datasets validate the robustness of our method over
arbitrarily placed cameras. Compared with other stereo and multi-camera visual
SLAM systems, our method obtains higher pose estimation accuracy with better
generalization ability. Our codes and online demos are available at

                                        <span>  Diffusion-based policies have shown impressive performance in robotic
manipulation tasks while struggling with out-of-domain distributions. Recent
efforts attempted to enhance generalization by improving the visual feature
encoding for diffusion policy. However, their generalization is typically
limited to the same category with similar appearances. Our key insight is that
leveraging affordances--manipulation priors that define "where" and "how" an
agent interacts with an object--can substantially enhance generalization to
entirely unseen object instances and categories. We introduce the Diffusion
Policy with transferable Affordance (AffordDP), designed for generalizable
manipulation across novel categories. AffordDP models affordances through 3D
contact points and post-contact trajectories, capturing the essential static
and dynamic information for complex tasks. The transferable affordance from
in-domain data to unseen objects is achieved by estimating a 6D transformation
matrix using foundational vision models and point cloud registration
techniques. More importantly, we incorporate affordance guidance during
diffusion sampling that can refine action sequence generation. This guidance
directs the generated action to gradually move towards the desired manipulation
for unseen objects while keeping the generated action within the manifold of
action space. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world
environments demonstrate that AffordDP consistently outperforms previous
diffusion-based methods, successfully generalizing to unseen instances and
categories where others fail.

unit to estimate the $SE(3)$ trajectory. However, the asynchronicity of event
cameras brings a great challenge to conventional fusion algorithms. In this
paper, we present an asynchronous event-inertial odometry under a unified
Gaussian Process (GP) regression framework to naturally fuse asynchronous data
associations and inertial measurements. A GP latent variable model is leveraged
to build data-driven motion prior and acquire the analytical integration
capacity. Then, asynchronous event-based feature associations and integral
pseudo measurements are tightly coupled using the same GP framework.
Subsequently, this fusion estimation problem is solved by underlying factor
graph in a sliding-window manner. With consideration of sparsity, those
historical states are marginalized orderly. A twin system is also designed for
comparison, where the traditional inertial preintegration scheme is embedded in
the GP-based framework to replace the GP latent variable model. Evaluations on
public event-inertial datasets demonstrate the validity of both systems.
Comparison experiments show competitive precision compared to the
state-of-the-art synchronous scheme.

integrated with the Nearly-Constant-Velocity (NCV) model to predict a moving

models that rely on a large number of trainable parameters, Point-GN leverages
non-learnable components-specifically, Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), k-Nearest
Neighbors (k-NN), and Gaussian Positional Encoding (GPE)-to extract both local
and global geometric features. This design eliminates the need for additional
training while maintaining high performance, making Point-GN particularly
suited for real-time, resource-constrained applications. We evaluate Point-GN
on two benchmark datasets, ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN, achieving
classification accuracies of 85.29% and 85.89%, respectively, while
significantly reducing computational complexity. Point-GN outperforms existing
non-parametric methods and matches the performance of fully trained models, all
with zero learnable parameters. Our results demonstrate that Point-GN is a
promising solution for 3D point cloud classification in practical, real-time
environments.

                                        <span>  Inspired by the embodied intelligence of biological creatures like the
octopus, the soft robotic arm utilizes its highly flexible structure to perform
various tasks in the complex environment. While the classic Cosserat rod theory
investigates the bending, twisting, shearing, and stretching of the soft arm,
it fails to capture the in-plane deformation that occurs during certain tasks,
particularly those involving active lateral traction. This paper introduces an
extended Cosserat rod theory addressing these limitations by incorporating an
extra strain variable reflecting the in-plane inflation ratio. To accurately
describe the viscoelasticity effect of the soft body in dynamics, the proposed
model enhances the constitutive law by integrating the Saint-Venant Kirchhoff
hyperelastic and Kelvin-Voigt viscous models. The active and environmental
loads are accounted for the equations of motion, which are numerically solved
by adapting the Geometric Variable Strain (GVS) approach to balance the
accuracy and computational efficiency. Our contributions include the derivation
of the extended Cosserat rod theory in dynamic context, and the development of
a reduced-order numerical method that enables rapid and precise solutions. We
demonstrate applications of the model in stiffness tuning of a soft robotic arm
and the study of complex octopus' arm motions.

reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we focus on the problem of how to
coordinate the floating base and the robotic arm of a wheeled-quadrupedal
manipulator robot to achieve direct six-dimensional (6D) end-effector (EE) pose
tracking in task space. Different from conventional whole-body
loco-manipulation problems that track both floating-base and end-effector
commands, the direct EE pose tracking problem requires inherent balance among
redundant degrees of freedom in the whole-body motion. We leverage RL to solve
this challenging problem. To address the associated difficulties, we develop a
novel reward fusion module (RFM) that systematically integrates reward terms
corresponding to different tasks in a nonlinear manner. In such a way, the
inherent multi-stage and hierarchical feature of the loco-manipulation problem
can be carefully accommodated. By combining the proposed RFM with the a
teacher-student RL training paradigm, we present a complete RL scheme to
achieve 6D EE pose tracking for the wheeled-quadruped manipulator robot.
Extensive simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate the significance of
the RFM. In particular, we enable smooth and precise tracking performance,
achieving state-of-the-art tracking position error of less than 5 cm, and
rotation error of less than 0.1 rad. Please refer to

                                        <span>  In the realm of large-scale point cloud registration, designing a compact
symbolic representation is crucial for efficiently processing vast amounts of
data, ensuring registration robustness against significant viewpoint variations
and occlusions. This paper introduces a novel point cloud registration method,
i.e., QuadricsReg, which leverages concise quadrics primitives to represent
scenes and utilizes their geometric characteristics to establish
correspondences for 6-DoF transformation estimation. As a symbolic feature, the
quadric representation fully captures the primary geometric characteristics of
scenes, which can efficiently handle the complexity of large-scale point
clouds. The intrinsic characteristics of quadrics, such as types and scales,
are employed to initialize correspondences. Then we build a multi-level
compatibility graph set to find the correspondences using the maximum clique on
the geometric consistency between quadrics. Finally, we estimate the 6-DoF
transformation using the quadric correspondences, which is further optimized
based on the quadric degeneracy-aware distance in a factor graph, ensuring high
registration accuracy and robustness against degenerate structures. We test on
5 public datasets and the self-collected heterogeneous dataset across different
LiDAR sensors and robot platforms. The exceptional registration success rates
and minimal registration errors demonstrate the effectiveness of QuadricsReg in
large-scale point cloud registration scenarios. Furthermore, the real-world
registration testing on our self-collected heterogeneous dataset shows the
robustness and generalization ability of QuadricsReg on different LiDAR sensors
and robot platforms. The codes and demos will be released at

independently of downstream decision-making and control components, relying on
established performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Traditional loss functions, such as cross-entropy loss and negative
log-likelihood, focus on reducing misclassification errors but fail to consider
their impact on system-level safety, overlooking the varying severities of
system-level failures caused by these errors. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel training paradigm that augments the perception component with
an understanding of system-level safety objectives. Central to our approach is
the translation of system-level safety requirements, formally specified using
the rulebook formalism, into safety scores. These scores are then incorporated
into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework for fine-tuning
perception models with system-level safety objectives. Simulation results
demonstrate that models trained with this approach outperform baseline
perception models in terms of system-level safety.

a localization system that is reliable and robust. While Visual Odometry (VO)
can offer a reasonable estimation of the robot's state, traditional VO methods
encounter challenges when confronted with dynamic objects in the scene.
Alternatively, an upward-facing camera can be utilized to track the robot's
movement relative to the ceiling, which represents a static and consistent
space. We introduce in this paper Ceiling-DSO, a ceiling-vision system based on
Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO). Unlike other ceiling-vision systems, Ceiling-DSO
takes advantage of the versatile formulation of DSO, avoiding assumptions about
observable shapes or landmarks on the ceiling. This approach ensures the
method's applicability to various ceiling types. Since no publicly available
dataset for ceiling-vision exists, we created a custom dataset in a real-world
scenario and employed it to evaluate our approach. By adjusting DSO parameters,
we identified the optimal fit for online pose estimation, resulting in
acceptable error rates compared to ground truth. We provide in this paper a
qualitative and quantitative analysis of the obtained results.

We propose employing multimodal LLMs for long-horizon planning in conjunction

employs a multimodal LLM as a zero-shot planner for long-horizon exploration

maximizing the information gain for the environment while minimizing the cost
of localization errors. Experiments conducted on the Gibson and

                                        <span>  Generating diverse and realistic human motion that can physically interact
with an environment remains a challenging research area in character animation.
Meanwhile, diffusion-based methods, as proposed by the robotics community, have
demonstrated the ability to capture highly diverse and multi-modal skills.
However, naively training a diffusion policy often results in unstable motions
for high-frequency, under-actuated control tasks like bipedal locomotion due to
rapidly accumulating compounding errors, pushing the agent away from optimal
training trajectories. The key idea lies in using RL policies not just for
providing optimal trajectories but for providing corrective actions in
sub-optimal states, giving the policy a chance to correct for errors caused by
environmental stimulus, model errors, or numerical errors in simulation. Our
method, Physics-Based Character Animation via Diffusion Policy (PDP), combines
reinforcement learning (RL) and behavior cloning (BC) to create a robust
diffusion policy for physics-based character animation. We demonstrate PDP on
perturbation recovery, universal motion tracking, and physics-based
text-to-motion synthesis.

                                        <span>  When using sampling-based motion planners, such as PRMs, in configuration
spaces, it is difficult to determine how many samples are required for the PRM
to find a solution consistently. This is relevant in Task and Motion Planning
(TAMP), where many motion planning problems must be solved in sequence. We
attempt to solve this problem by proving an upper bound on the number of
samples that are sufficient, with high probability, to find a solution by
drawing on prior work in deterministic sampling and sample complexity theory.
We also introduce a numerical algorithm to compute a tighter number of samples
based on the proof of the sample complexity theorem we apply to derive our
bound. Our experiments show that our numerical bounding algorithm is tight
within two orders of magnitude on planar planning problems and becomes looser
as the problem's dimensionality increases. When deployed as a heuristic to
schedule samples in a TAMP planner, we also observe planning time improvements
in planar problems. While our experiments show much work remains to tighten our
bounds, the ideas presented in this paper are a step towards a practical sample
bound.

                                        <span>  The generation of high-fidelity view synthesis is essential for robotic
navigation and interaction but remains challenging, particularly in indoor
environments and real-time scenarios. Existing techniques often require
significant computational resources for both training and rendering, and they
frequently result in suboptimal 3D representations due to insufficient
geometric structuring. To address these limitations, we introduce VoxNeRF, a
novel approach that utilizes easy-to-obtain geometry priors to enhance both the
quality and efficiency of neural indoor reconstruction and novel view
synthesis. We propose an efficient voxel-guided sampling technique that
allocates computational resources selectively to the most relevant segments of
rays based on a voxel-encoded geometry prior, significantly reducing training
and rendering time. Additionally, we incorporate a robust depth loss to improve
reconstruction and rendering quality in sparse view settings. Our approach is
validated with extensive experiments on ScanNet and ScanNet++ where VoxNeRF
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and establishes a new benchmark
for indoor immersive interpolation and extrapolation settings.

                                        <span>  We present a framework for assistive robot manipulation, which focuses on two
fundamental challenges: first, efficiently adapting large-scale models to
downstream scene affordance understanding tasks, especially in daily living
scenarios where gathering multi-task data involving humans requires strenuous
effort; second, effectively learning robot trajectories by grounding the visual
affordance model. We tackle the first challenge by employing a
parameter-efficient prompt tuning method that prepends learnable text prompts
to the frozen vision model to predict manipulation affordances in multi-task
scenarios. Then we propose to learn robot trajectories guided by affordances in
a supervised Flow Matching method. Flow matching represents a robot visuomotor
policy as a conditional process of flowing random waypoints to desired robot
trajectories. Finally, we introduce a real-world dataset with 10 tasks across
Activities of Daily Living to test our framework. Our extensive evaluation
highlights that the proposed prompt tuning method for learning manipulation
affordance with language prompter achieves competitive performance and even
outperforms other finetuning protocols across data scales, while satisfying
parameter efficiency. Learning multi-task robot trajectories with flow matching
policy also leads to consistently better results than alternative behavior
cloning methods, including marginally better generalization performance and
prominently faster inference than diffusion policy with DDPM. Our framework
seamlessly unifies affordance model learning and trajectory generation with
flow matching for robot manipulation.

trial-and-error learning without relying on strong inductive biases.
Traditional robotic designs, while well-suited for their specific use cases,
are often fragile when used with these algorithms. To address this gap -- and
inspired by the vision of enabling curiosity-driven baby robots -- we present a
novel robotic limb designed from scratch. Our design has a hybrid soft-hard

and easily replaceable failure points. Proof-of-concept experiments using two
contemporary reinforcement learning algorithms on a physical prototype
demonstrate that our design is able to succeed in a simple target-finding task
even under simulated sensor failures, all with minimal human oversight during
extended learning periods. We believe this design represents a concrete step
toward more tailored robotic designs for achieving general-purpose, generally
intelligent robots.

                                        <span>  We present a novel autonomous driving framework, DualAD, designed to imitate
human reasoning during driving. DualAD comprises two layers: a rule-based
motion planner at the bottom layer that handles routine driving tasks requiring
minimal reasoning, and an upper layer featuring a rule-based text encoder that
converts driving scenarios from absolute states into text description. This
text is then processed by a large language model (LLM) to make driving
decisions. The upper layer intervenes in the bottom layer's decisions when
potential danger is detected, mimicking human reasoning in critical situations.
Closed-loop experiments demonstrate that DualAD, using a zero-shot pre-trained
model, significantly outperforms rule-based motion planners that lack reasoning
abilities. Our experiments also highlight the effectiveness of the text
encoder, which considerably enhances the model's scenario understanding.
Additionally, the integrated DualAD model improves with stronger LLMs,
indicating the framework's potential for further enhancement. Code and
benchmarks are available at github.com/TUM-AVS/DualAD.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose an efficient contact planner for quadrupedal robots
to navigate in extremely constrained environments such as stepping stones. The
main difficulty in this setting stems from the mixed nature of the problem,
namely discrete search over the steppable patches and continuous trajectory
optimization. To speed up the discrete search, we study the properties of the
transitions from one contact mode to another. In particular, we propose to
learn a dynamic feasibility classifier and a target adjustment network. The
former predicts if a contact transition between two contact modes is
dynamically feasible. The latter is trained to compensate for misalignment in
reaching a desired set of contact locations, due to imperfections of the
low-level control. We integrate these learned networks in a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) contact planner. Our simulation results demonstrate that training
these networks with offline data significantly speeds up the online search
process and improves its accuracy.

real-world mapless outdoor navigation in human-centered environments. Such
environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are
easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute
suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability
constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks,
sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder
(CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate
multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual
prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot
ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best
trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our
method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the
performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an
average improvement of 22.07% in satisfying traversability constraints and
30.53% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation
scenarios.

                                        <span>  Autonomous robots must utilize rich sensory data to make safe control
decisions. To process this data, compute-constrained robots often require
assistance from remote computation, or the cloud, that runs compute-intensive
deep neural network perception or control models. However, this assistance
comes at the cost of a time delay due to network latency, resulting in past
observations being used in the cloud to compute the control commands for the
present robot state. Such communication delays could potentially lead to the
violation of essential safety properties, such as collision avoidance. This
paper develops methods to ensure the safety of robots operated over
communication networks with stochastic latency. To do so, we use tools from
formal verification to construct a shield, i.e., a run-time monitor, that
provides a list of safe actions for any delayed sensory observation, given the
expected and maximum network latency. Our shield is minimally intrusive and
enables networked robots to satisfy key safety constraints, expressed as
temporal logic specifications, with desired probability. We demonstrate our
approach on a real F1/10th autonomous vehicle that navigates in indoor
environments and transmits rich LiDAR sensory data over congested WiFi links.

autonomous mobile robots. In this letter, we address the problem of robust
localization in cluttered indoor environments like office spaces and corridors
using 3D LiDAR point clouds in a given Area Graph, which is a hierarchical,
topometric semantic map representation that uses polygons to demark areas such
as rooms, corridors or buildings. This representation is very compact, can
represent different floors of buildings through its hierarchy and provides
semantic information that helps with localization, like poses of doors and
glass. In contrast to this, commonly used map representations, such as
occupancy grid maps or point clouds, lack these features and require frequent
updates in response to environmental changes (e.g. moved furniture), unlike our
approach, which matches against lifelong architectural features such as walls
and doors. For that we apply filtering to remove clutter from the 3D input
point cloud and then employ further scoring and weight functions for
localization. Given a broad initial guess from WiFi localization, our
experiments show that our global localization and the weighted point to line
ICP pose tracking perform very well, even when compared to localization and
SLAM algorithms that use the current, feature-rich cluttered map for
localization.

framework for executing high level robotic planning in a zero-shot regime. In
our context, zero-shot high-level planning means that for a novel environment,
we provide a VLLM with an image of the robot's surroundings and a task
description, and the VLLM outputs the sequence of actions necessary for the
robot to complete the task. Unlike previous methods for high-level visual
planning for robotic manipulation, our method uses VLLMs for the entire
planning process, enabling a more tightly integrated loop between perception,
control, and planning. As a result, Wonderful Team's performance on a
real-world semantic and physical planning tasks often exceeds methods that rely
on separate vision systems. For example, we see an average 40% success-rate
improvement on VimaBench over prior methods such as NLaP, an average 30%
improvement over Trajectory Generators on tasks from the Trajectory Generator
paper including drawing and wiping a plate, and an average 70% improvement over
Trajectory Generators on a new set of semantic reasoning tasks including
environment re-arrangement with implicit linguistic constraints. We hope these
results highlight the rapid improvements of VLLMs in the past year, and
motivate the community to consider VLLMs as an option for some high-level
robotic planning problems in the future.

nodes within the Internet of Things (IoT). Graph generative models are often
used to address the issue of imbalanced node categories in dynamic graphs.
Nevertheless, the constraints it faces include the monotonicity of adjacency
relationships, the difficulty in constructing multi-dimensional features for
nodes, and the lack of a method for end-to-end generation of multiple
categories of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel graph generation model,
called CGGM, specifically for generating samples belonging to the minority
class. The framework consists two core module: a conditional graph generation
module and a graph-based anomaly detection module. The generative module adapts
to the sparsity of the matrix by downsampling a noise adjacency matrix, and
incorporates a multi-dimensional feature encoder based on multi-head
self-attention to capture latent dependencies among features. Additionally, a
latent space constraint is combined with the distribution distance to
approximate the latent distribution of real data. The graph-based anomaly
detection module utilizes the generated balanced dataset to predict the node
behaviors. Extensive experiments have shown that CGGM outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and divergence. The results also
demonstrate CGGM can generated diverse data categories, that enhancing the
performance of multi-category classification task.

autonomous vehicles, robotics, and surveillance systems. Yet, existing models
often fail to fully leverage the non-verbal social cues human subconsciously
communicate when navigating the space. To address this, we introduce
Social-Transmotion, a generic Transformer-based model that exploits diverse and
numerous visual cues to predict human behavior. We translate the idea of a
prompt from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the task of human trajectory
prediction, where a prompt can be a sequence of x-y coordinates on the ground,
bounding boxes in the image plane, or body pose keypoints in either 2D or 3D.
This, in turn, augments trajectory data, leading to enhanced human trajectory
prediction. Using masking technique, our model exhibits flexibility and
adaptability by capturing spatiotemporal interactions between agents based on
the available visual cues. We delve into the merits of using 2D versus 3D
poses, and a limited set of poses. Additionally, we investigate the spatial and
temporal attention map to identify which keypoints and time-steps in the
sequence are vital for optimizing human trajectory prediction. Our approach is
validated on multiple datasets, including JTA, JRDB, Pedestrians and Cyclists
in Road Traffic, and ETH-UCY. The code is publicly available:

the nominal closed-loop system used to enforce constraints by time-shifting the

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), an emerging architecture in the AI

simulations of constrained spacecraft rendezvous missions on highly elliptic

                                        <span>  Ensuring security for highly dynamic peer-to-peer (P2P) networks has always
been a challenge, especially for services like online transactions and smart
devices. These networks experience high churn rates, making it difficult to
maintain appropriate access control. Traditional systems, particularly
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), often fail to meet the needs of a P2P
environment. This paper presents a blockchain-based access control framework
that uses Ethereum smart contracts to address these challenges. Our framework
aims to close the gaps in existing access control systems by providing
flexible, transparent, and decentralized security solutions. The proposed
framework includes access control contracts (ACC) that manage access based on
static and dynamic policies, a Judge Contract (JC) to handle misbehavior, and a
Register Contract (RC) to record and manage the interactions between ACCs and
JC. The security model combines impact and severity-based threat assessments
using the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and STRIDE principles,
ensuring responses are tailored to different threat levels. This system not
only stabilizes the fundamental issues of peer membership but also offers a
scalable solution, particularly valuable in areas such as the Internet of
Things (IoT) and Web 3.0 technologies.

functions (CBFs) from high relative degree safety constraints: Rectified CBFs
(ReCBFs). We begin by discussing the limitations of existing High-Order CBF
approaches and how these can be overcome by incorporating an activation
function into the CBF construction. We then provide a comparative analysis of
our approach with related methods, such as CBF backstepping. Our results are
presented first for safety constraints with relative degree two, then for
mixed-input relative degree constraints, and finally for higher relative
degrees. The theoretical developments are illustrated through simple running
examples and an aircraft control problem.

                                        <span>  In this paper we study the asymptotics of linear regression in settings where
the covariates exhibit a linear dependency structure, departing from the
standard assumption of independence. We model the covariates using stochastic
processes with spatio-temporal covariance and analyze the performance of ridge
regression in the high-dimensional proportional regime, where the number of
samples and feature dimensions grow proportionally. A Gaussian universality
theorem is proven, demonstrating that the asymptotics are invariant under
replacing the covariates with Gaussian vectors preserving mean and covariance.
Next, leveraging tools from random matrix theory, we derive precise
characterizations of the estimation error. The estimation error is
characterized by a fixed-point equation involving the spectral properties of
the spatio-temporal covariance matrices, enabling efficient computation. We
then study optimal regularization, overparameterization, and the double descent
phenomenon in the context of dependent data. Simulations validate our
theoretical predictions, shedding light on how dependencies influence
estimation error and the choice of regularization parameters.

                                        <span>  As bipedal robots become more and more popular in commercial and industrial
settings, the ability to control them with a high degree of reliability is
critical. To that end, this paper considers how to accurately estimate which
feet are currently in contact with the ground so as to avoid improper control
actions that could jeopardize the stability of the robot. Additionally, modern
algorithms for estimating the position and orientation of a robot's base frame
rely heavily on such contact mode estimates. Dedicated contact sensors on the
feet can be used to estimate this contact mode, but these sensors are prone to
noise, time delays, damage/yielding from repeated impacts with the ground, and
are not available on every robot. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
momentum observer based method for contact mode estimation that does not rely
on such contact sensors. Often, momentum observers assume that the robot's base
frame can be treated as an inertial frame. However, since many humanoids' legs
represent a significant portion of the overall mass, the proposed method
instead utilizes multiple simultaneous dynamic models. Each of these models
assumes a different contact condition. A given contact assumption is then used
to constrain the full dynamics in order to avoid assuming that either the body
is an inertial frame or that a fully accurate estimate of body velocity is
known. The (dis)agreement between each model's estimates and measurements is
used to determine which contact mode is most likely using a Markov-style fusion
method. The proposed method produces contact detection accuracy of up to 98.44%
with a low noise simulation and 77.12% when utilizing data collect on the
Sarcos Guardian XO robot (a hybrid humanoid/exoskeleton).

to increase the capacitor lifetime in various applications. In this paper, a
deep neural network-based phase-shifting (PS) technique is proposed for
parallel-connected buck converters to minimize the amplitude of a selective
harmonic component and facilitate a classic optimum PS at the same time. The
proposed method identifies the global optimum point in real time, without the
need for complicated computations. The common-link current, common-link
voltage, and the duty ratios are selected as the inputs of the neural network
to provide the proper phase shifts for the switching signals. To accumulate the
required dataset, a Different Start-Same Step (DSSS) technique is also
introduced to generate the training data and test/validation data in a separate
way. The effect of the number of hidden layers on the network output error is
investigated, and a proper number of hidden layers is designed based on a
compromise between accuracy and computation efficiency (and execution time).
Experimental results prove that the proposed artificial neural network-based PS
method preserves the performance of classic optimum PS and minimizing the
implementation time significantly.

                                        <span>  The physical coupling between robots has the potential to improve the
capabilities of multi-robot systems in challenging manufacturing processes.
However, the path tracking accuracy of physically coupled robots is not studied
adequately, especially considering the uncertain kinematic parameters, the
mechanical elasticity, and the built-in controllers of off-the-shelf robots.
This paper addresses these issues with a novel differential-algebraic system
model which is verified against measurement data from real execution. The
uncertain kinematic parameters are estimated online to adapt the model.
Consequently, an adaptive model predictive controller is designed as a
coordinator between the robots. The controller achieves a path tracking error
reduction of 88.6% compared to the state-of-the-art benchmark in the
simulation.

                                        <span>  Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) software is used to enforce desired behaviours
on physical systems. To test the interaction between the CPS software and the
system's physics, engineers provide traces of desired physical states and
observe traces of the actual physical states. CPS requirements describe how
closely the actual physical traces should track the desired traces. These
requirements are typically defined for specific, simple input traces such as
step or ramp sequences, and thus are not applicable to arbitrary inputs. This
limits the availability of oracles for CPSs. Our recent work proposes an
approach to testing CPS using control-theoretical design assumptions instead of
requirements. This approach circumvents the oracle problem by leveraging the
control-theoretical guarantees that are provided when the design assumptions
are satisfied. To address the test case generation and oracle problems,
researchers have proposed metamorphic testing, which is based on the study of
relations across tests, i.e., metamorphic relations (MRs). In this work, we
define MRs based on the design assumptions and explore combinations of these
MRs using genetic programming to generate CPS test cases. This enables the
generation of CPS input traces with potentially arbitrary shapes, together with
associated expected output traces. We use the deviation from the expected
output traces to guide the generation of input traces that falsify the MRs. Our
experiment results show that the MR-falsification provides engineers with new
information, helping them identify passed and failed test cases. Furthermore,
we show that the generation of traces that falsify the MRs is a non-trivial
problem, which is successfully addressed by our genetic search.

human dexterity without sacrificing the efficiency of industrial grippers. This
study introduces Rotograb, a tendon-actuated robotic hand featuring a novel
rotating thumb. The aim is to combine the dexterity of human hands with the
efficiency of industrial grippers. The rotating thumb enlarges the workspace
and allows in-hand manipulation. A novel joint design minimizes movement
interference and simplifies kinematics, using a cutout for tendon routing. We
integrate teleoperation, using a depth camera for real-time tracking and
autonomous manipulation powered by reinforcement learning with proximal policy
optimization. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Rotograb's rotating
thumb greatly improves both operational versatility and workspace. It can
handle various grasping and manipulation tasks with objects from the YCB
dataset, with particularly good results when rotating objects within its grasp.
Rotograb represents a notable step towards bridging the capability gap between
human hands and industrial grippers. The tendon-routing and thumb-rotating
mechanisms allow for a new level of control and dexterity. Integrating
teleoperation and autonomous learning underscores Rotograb's adaptability and
sophistication, promising substantial advancements in both robotics research
and practical applications.

disconnection of small-scale DERs in low-voltage distribution grids during
disturbances poses a serious threat to power system security. However, modeling
this effect in a computationally efficient way remains challenging. This paper
proposes a novel proportional-integral aggregate model for predicting the
fraction of tripped DERs based on the voltage at the substation connection
point. The model effectively captures the cumulative behavior of the system, is
simple to implement, and includes seven parameters for undervoltage tripping
and seven for overvoltage tripping behavior, each with a distinct physical
meaning. We further propose an optimization-based approach to tune the model
parameters. Simulation results show significantly more accurate predictions
compared to the DER\_A model -- a standard dynamic model for aggregate DER
behavior -- even when the latter is optimized, with only a minor increase in
model complexity.

                                        <span>  Trajectory optimization is a widely used tool in the design and control of
dynamical systems. Typically, not only nonlinear dynamics, but also couplings
of the initial and final condition through implicit boundary constraints render
the optimization problem non-convex. This paper investigates how the Koopman
operator framework can be utilized to solve trajectory optimization problems in
a (partially) convex fashion. While the Koopman operator has already been
successfully employed in model predictive control, the challenge of addressing
mixed boundary constraints within the Koopman framework has remained an open
question. We first address this issue by explaining why a complete
convexification of the problem is not possible. Secondly, we propose a method
where we transform the trajectory optimization problem into a bilevel problem
in which we are then able to convexify the high-dimensional lower-level
problem. This separation yields a low-dimensional upper-level problem, which
could be exploited in global optimization algorithms. Lastly, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of the method on two example systems: the mathematical
pendulum and the compass-gait walker.

tracking framework utilizing a Consensus-Based Estimation Filter (CBEF)
integrated with the Nearly-Constant-Velocity (NCV) model to predict a moving

                                        <span>  We consider the problem of recovering the topology and the edge conductance
value, as well as characterizing a set of electrical networks that satisfy the
limitedly available Thevenin impedance measurements. The measurements are
obtained from an unknown electrical network, which is assumed to belong to a
class of circular planar passive electrical network. This class of electrical
networks consists of R, RL, and RC networks whose edge impedance values are
equal, and the absolute value of the real and the imaginary part of the edge
impedances are also equal. To solve the topology reconstruction and the set
characterization problem, we establish a simple relation between Thevenin
impedance and the Laplacian matrix and leverage this relation to get a system
of multivariate polynomial equations, whose solution is a set of all electrical
networks satisfying the limited available Thevenin's impedance measurements. To
confine the search space and generate valid electrical networks, we impose the
triangle and Kalmanson's inequality as constraints. The solution to a
constrained system of multivariate polynomial equations is a set of
reconstructed valid electrical networks. For simple algorithmic solutions, we
use Gr\"obner basis polynomials. This paper shows that the triangle and the
Kalmanson's inequality holds for general circular planar passive R, RL, and RC
electrical networks if certain boundary conditions lie within a convex cone.
Numerical examples illustrate the developed topology reconstruction method.

                                        <span>  Specifications - precise mathematical representations of correct
domain-specific behaviors - are crucial to guarantee the trustworthiness of
computer systems. With the increasing development of neural networks as
computer system components, specifications gain more importance as they can be
used to regulate the behaviors of these black-box models. Traditionally,
specifications are designed by domain experts based on their intuition of
correct behavior. However, this is labor-intensive and hence not a scalable
approach as computer system applications diversify. We hypothesize that the
traditional (aka reference) algorithms that neural networks replace for higher
performance can act as effective proxies for correct behaviors of the models,
when available. This is because they have been used and tested for long enough
to encode several aspects of the trustworthy/correct behaviors in the
underlying domain. Driven by our hypothesis, we develop a novel automated
framework, SpecTRA to generate specifications for neural networks using
references. We formulate specification generation as an optimization problem
and solve it with observations of reference behaviors. SpecTRA clusters similar
observations into compact specifications. We present specifications generated
by SpecTRA for neural networks in adaptive bit rate and congestion control
algorithms. Our specifications show evidence of being correct and matching
intuition. Moreover, we use our specifications to show several unknown
vulnerabilities of the SOTA models for computer systems.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes a novel robust model predictive control (RMPC) method for
the stabilization of constrained systems subject to additive disturbance (AD)
and multiplicative disturbance (MD). Concentric containers are introduced to
facilitate the characterization of MD, and varying tubes are constructed to
bound reachable states. By restricting states and the corresponding inputs in
containers with free sizes and a fixed shape, feasible MDs, which are the
products of model uncertainty with states and inputs, are restricted into
polytopes with free sizes. Then, tubes with different centers and shapes are
constructed based on the nominal dynamics and the knowledge of AD and MD. The
free sizes of containers allow for a more accurate characterization of MD,
while the fixed shape reduces online computational burden, making the proposed
method less conservative and computationally efficient. Moreover, the shape of
containers is optimized to further reduce conservativeness. Compared to the
RMPC method using homothetic tubes, the proposed method has a larger region of
attraction while involving fewer decision variables and constraints in the
online optimization problem.

                                        <span>  In this study, we analyze the stability of a path-tracking controller
designed for a four-wheel steering vehicle, incorporating the effects of the
reference path curvature. By employing a simplified kinematic model of the
vehicle with steerable front and rear wheels, we derive analytical expressions
for the stability regions and optimal control gains specific to different
four-wheel steering strategies. To simplify our calculations, we keep the rear
steering angle $\delta_r$ proportional to the front steering angle $\delta_f$
by using the constant parameter $a$, i.e., $\delta_r = a\delta_f$, where
$\delta_f$ is calculated from a control law having both feedforward and
feedback terms. Our findings, supported by stability charts and numerical
simulations, indicate that for high velocities and paths of small curvatures,
the appropriately tuned four-wheel steering controller significantly reduces
lateral acceleration and enhances path-tracking performance when compared to
using only front-wheel steering. Furthermore, for low velocities and large
curvatures, the using negative a values (i.e., steering the rear wheels in the
opposite direction than the front wheels) allows for a reduced turning radius,
increasing the vehicle's capability to perform sharp turns in confined spaces
like in parking lots or on narrow roads.

flexibility, and mitigate carbon emissions. However, the challenge of
identifying individual control-oriented building dynamic models limits
large-scale real-world applications. To address this issue, this study proposed
a Modularized Neural Network Incorporating Physical Priors (ModNN), capable of
establishing a control-oriented and physical-consistent building dynamic model
within minutes without substantial modeling effort. This is also the first
study to evaluate the physical consistency of a given data-driven model both
qualitatively and quantitively. We compared the physical consistency of a
classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and our ModNN. The ModNN strictly
satisfies physical constraints, whereas the LSTM model learned contradictory
system dynamics. Additionally, we compared their control performance on an
EnergyPlus virtual testbed. While the LSTM model demonstrated slightly better
prediction accuracy in dynamic modeling, it failed in control optimization,
resulting in an 89{\deg}C-h temperature violation, whereas the ModNN showed
only a 0.57{\deg}C-h violation and achieved up to a 78% peak load reduction.
Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating physics priors into
data-driven models and provide a promising solution for future smart building
control optimization. Furthermore, the proposed evaluation framework defines
two physical consistency indicators, providing guidelines for selecting and
testing control-oriented, data-driven building dynamic models.

Head-Mounted Display (HMD) devices, to provide expert personnel-aided decision
support for maintenance technicians, with the association of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) solutions. The study explores the user experience aspect of
AR interfaces in a simulated industrial environment, aiming to improve the
maintenance processes' intuitiveness and effectiveness. Evaluation metrics such
as the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) and the System Usability Scale (SUS) are
employed to assess the usability, performance, and workload implications of the
AR maintenance system. Additionally, the paper discusses the technical
implementation, methodology, and results of experiments conducted to evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

                                        <span>  In-wheel drive (IWD) systems enhance the responsiveness, traction, and
maintenance efficiency of vehicles by enabling each wheel to operate
independently. This paper proposes a novel robust torque-observed valve-based
control (RTOVC) framework to address velocity tracking in hydraulic IWDs that
actuate heavy-duty wheeled mobile robots (HWMRs), considering such challenges
as wheel slippages, sensor limitations, rough terrains, and modeling
uncertainties. To overcome the sensor-dependent control systems associated with
the closed-loop torque/pressure in hydraulic IWD-actuated HWMRs, a robust
observer network based on an adaptive barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is
proposed to estimate the required in-wheel motor torque to track the velocity
references. Then, another adaptive BLF for valve control signals is employed to
modulate the hydraulic fluid to generate the estimated torque for each IWD. The
RTOVC strategy ensures user-defined safety within the logarithmic BLF framework
by constraining the valve control signal, actual velocity, velocity tracking
error, and torque of each hydraulic IWD in an HWMR to avoid exceeding specified
limits. Despite its safety constraints, external disturbances, and modeling
uncertainties, robustness and uniformly exponential stability of the
RTOVC-applied hydraulic IWD mechanism are ensured in HWMRs. Experimental
investigations using a 6,500-kg HWMR, actuated by four independent IWDs under
intense disturbances and safety-defined constraints, validate the performance
of the RTOVC.

                                        <span>  Minimising cycle time without inducing quality defects is a major challenge
in the injection moulding (IM). Design of Experiment methods (DoE) have been
widely studied for optimisation of the IM, however existing methods have
limitations, including the need for a large number of experiments and a
pre-determined search space. Bayesian adaptive design of experiment (ADoE) is
an iterative process where the results of the previous experiments are used to
make an informed selection for the next design. In this study, for the first
time, an experimental ADoE approach, based on Bayesian optimisation, was
developed in injection moulding using process and sensor data to optimise the
quality and cycle time in real-time. A novel approach for the real-time
characterisation of post-production shrinkage was introduced, utilising
in-mould sensor data on temperature differential during part cooling. This
characterisation approach was verified by post-production metrology results.
  A single and multi-objective optimisation of the cycle time and temperature
differential in an injection moulded component is proposed. The multi-objective
optimisation techniques, composite desirability function and Nondominated
Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) using Response Surface Methodology (RSM)
model, are compared with the real-time novel ADoE approach. ADoE achieved
almost a 50% reduction in the number of experiments required for the single
optimisation of temperature differential, and an almost 30% decrease for the
optimisation of temperature differential and cycle time together compared to
composite desirability function and NSGA-II. Also, the optimal settings
identified by ADoE for multiobjective optimisation were similar to the selected
Pareto optimal solution found by the NSGA-II.

                                        <span>  Learning identifiable representations and models from low-level observations
is helpful for an intelligent spacecraft to complete downstream tasks reliably.
For temporal observations, to ensure that the data generating process is
provably inverted, most existing works either assume the noise variables in the
dynamic mechanisms are (conditionally) independent or require that the
interventions can directly affect each latent variable. However, in practice,
the relationship between the exogenous inputs/interventions and the latent
variables may follow some complex deterministic mechanisms. In this work, we
study the problem of identifiable representation and model learning for latent
dynamic systems. The key idea is to use an inductive bias inspired by
controllable canonical forms, which are sparse and input-dependent by
definition. We prove that, for linear and affine nonlinear latent dynamic
systems with sparse input matrices, it is possible to identify the latent
variables up to scaling and determine the dynamic models up to some simple
transformations. The results have the potential to provide some theoretical
guarantees for developing more trustworthy decision-making and control methods
for intelligent spacecrafts.

                                        <span>  Autonomous robots must utilize rich sensory data to make safe control
decisions. To process this data, compute-constrained robots often require
assistance from remote computation, or the cloud, that runs compute-intensive
deep neural network perception or control models. However, this assistance
comes at the cost of a time delay due to network latency, resulting in past
observations being used in the cloud to compute the control commands for the
present robot state. Such communication delays could potentially lead to the
violation of essential safety properties, such as collision avoidance. This
paper develops methods to ensure the safety of robots operated over
communication networks with stochastic latency. To do so, we use tools from
formal verification to construct a shield, i.e., a run-time monitor, that
provides a list of safe actions for any delayed sensory observation, given the
expected and maximum network latency. Our shield is minimally intrusive and
enables networked robots to satisfy key safety constraints, expressed as
temporal logic specifications, with desired probability. We demonstrate our
approach on a real F1/10th autonomous vehicle that navigates in indoor
environments and transmits rich LiDAR sensory data over congested WiFi links.

                                        <span>  Network interference has garnered significant interest in the field of causal
inference. It reflects diverse sociological behaviors, wherein the treatment
assigned to one individual within a network may influence the outcome of other
individuals, such as their neighbors. To estimate the causal effect, one
classical way is to randomly assign experimental candidates into different
groups and compare their differences. However, in the context of sequential
experiments, such treatment assignment may result in a large regret. In this
paper, we develop a unified interference-based online experimental design
framework. Compared to existing literature, we expand the definition of arm
space by leveraging the statistical concept of exposure mapping. Importantly,
we establish the Pareto-optimal trade-off between the estimation accuracy and
regret with respect to both time period and arm space, which remains superior
to the baseline even in the absence of network interference. We further propose
an algorithmic implementation and model generalization.

                                        <span>  In this paper we provide a novel mathematical optimization based methodology
to perturb the features of a given observation to be re-classified, by a tree
ensemble classification rule, to a certain desired class. The method is based
on these facts: the most viable changes for an observation to reach the desired
class do not always coincide with the closest distance point (in the feature
space) of the target class; individuals put effort on a few number of features
to reach the desired class; and each individual is endowed with a probability
to change each of its features to a given value, which determines the overall
probability of changing to the target class. Putting all together, we provide
different methods to find the features where the individuals must exert effort
to maximize the probability to reach the target class. Our method also allows
us to rank the most important features in the tree-ensemble. The proposed
methodology is tested on a real dataset, validating the proposal.

                                        <span>  In safety-critical control, managing safety constraints with high relative
degrees and uncertain obstacle dynamics pose significant challenges in
guaranteeing safety performance. Robust Control Barrier Functions (RCBFs) offer
a potential solution, but the non-smoothness of the standard RCBF definition
can pose a challenge when dealing with multiple derivatives in high relative
degree problems. As a result, the definition was extended to the marginally
more conservative smooth Robust Control Barrier Functions (sRCBF). Then, by
extending the sRCBF framework to the CBF backstepping method, this paper offers
a novel approach to these problems. Treating obstacle dynamics as disturbances,
our approach reduces the requirement for precise state estimations of the
obstacle to an upper bound on the disturbance, which simplifies implementation
and enhances the robustness and applicability of CBFs in dynamic and uncertain
environments. Then, we validate our technique through an example problem in
which an agent, modeled using a kinematic unicycle model, aims to avoid an
unknown moving obstacle. The demonstration shows that the standard CBF
backstepping method is not sufficient in the presence of a moving obstacle,
especially with unknown dynamics. In contrast, the proposed method successfully
prevents the agent from colliding with the obstacle, proving its effectiveness.

drive a molecule from an initial state to a desired target state. For even
moderately sized molecules, solving this problem directly using the exact
equations of motion -- the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) -- is
numerically intractable. We present a solution of this problem within
time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory, a mean field approximation of the
TDSE. Optimality is defined in terms of minimizing the total control effort
while maximizing the overlap between desired and achieved target states. We
frame this problem as an optimization problem constrained by the nonlinear TDHF
equations; we solve it using trust region optimization with gradients computed
via a custom-built adjoint state method. For three molecular systems, we show
that with very small neural network parametrizations of the control, our method
yields solutions that achieve desired targets within acceptable constraints and
tolerances.

                                        <span>  We study a system with finitely many groups of multi-action bandit processes,
each of which is a Markov decision process (MDP) with finite state and action
spaces and potentially different transition matrices when taking different
actions. The bandit processes of the same group share the same state and action
spaces and, given the same action that is taken, the same transition matrix.
All the bandit processes across various groups are subject to multiple weakly
coupled constraints over their state and action variables. Unlike the past
studies that focused on the offline case, we consider the online case without
assuming full knowledge of transition matrices and reward functions a priori
and propose an effective scheme that enables simultaneous learning and control.
We prove the convergence of the relevant processes in both the timeline and the
number of the bandit processes, referred to as the convergence in the time and
the magnitude dimensions. Moreover, we prove that the relevant processes
converge exponentially fast in the magnitude dimension, leading to
exponentially diminishing performance deviation between the proposed online
algorithms and offline optimality.

the wavefunction on a simplex, and an explicit permutation for evaluating the
wavefunction on the whole space. We provide numerical results on a toy problem

subject to parameter perturbations, forming an ensemble of systems. Our
objective is to steer this ensemble from the initial distribution to the final
distribution using controls robust to the parameter perturbations. Utilizing
the path integral formalism, we demonstrate that the optimal control is a
non-Markovian strategy, specifically a stochastic feedforward control, which
depends on past and present noise. This unexpected deviation from established
strategies for Schr\"odinger bridge problems highlights the intricate
interrelationships present in the system's dynamics. From the perspective of
optimal transport, a significant by-product of our work is the demonstration
that, when the evolution of a distribution is subject to parameter
perturbations, it is possible to robustly deform the distribution to a desired
final state using stochastic feedforward controls.

neural ODEs and jump at arrival of new observations. They have demonstrated
effectiveness for fully data-driven online forecasting in settings with
irregular and partial observations, operating under weak regularity
assumptions. This work extends the framework to input-output systems, enabling
direct applications in online filtering and classification. We establish
theoretical convergence guarantees for this approach, providing a robust
solution to $L^2$-optimal filtering. Empirical experiments highlight the
model's superior performance over classical parametric methods, particularly in
scenarios with complex underlying distributions. These results emphasise the
approach's potential in time-sensitive domains such as finance and health
monitoring, where real-time accuracy is crucial.

                                        <span>  Opinion and belief dynamics are a central topic in the study of social
interactions through dynamical systems. In this work, we study a model where,
at each discrete time, all the agents update their opinion as an average of
their intrinsic opinion and the opinion of their neighbors. While it is
well-known how to compute the stable opinion state for a given network,
studying the dynamics becomes challenging when the network is uncertain.
Motivated by the task of finding optimal policies by a decision-maker that aims
to incorporate the opinion of the agents, we address the question of how well
the stable opinions can be approximated when the underlying network is random.
  We consider Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs to model the uncertain network.
Under the connectivity regime and an assumption of minimal stubbornness, we
show the expected value of the stable opinion $\mathbf{E}(x(G,\infty))$
concentrates, as the size of the network grows, around the stable opinion
$\bar{x}(\infty)$ obtained by considering a mean-field dynamical system, i.e.,
averaging over the possible network realizations. For both the directed and
undirected graph model, the concentration holds under the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm
to measure the gap between $\mathbf{E}(x(G,\infty))$ and $\bar{x}(\infty)$. We
deduce this result by studying a mean-field approximation of general analytic
matrix functions. The approximation result for the directed graph model also
holds for any $\ell_{\rho}$-norm with $\rho\in (1,\infty)$, under a slightly
enhanced expected average degree.

                                        <span>  Trajectory optimization is a widely used tool in the design and control of
dynamical systems. Typically, not only nonlinear dynamics, but also couplings
of the initial and final condition through implicit boundary constraints render
the optimization problem non-convex. This paper investigates how the Koopman
operator framework can be utilized to solve trajectory optimization problems in
a (partially) convex fashion. While the Koopman operator has already been
successfully employed in model predictive control, the challenge of addressing
mixed boundary constraints within the Koopman framework has remained an open
question. We first address this issue by explaining why a complete
convexification of the problem is not possible. Secondly, we propose a method
where we transform the trajectory optimization problem into a bilevel problem
in which we are then able to convexify the high-dimensional lower-level
problem. This separation yields a low-dimensional upper-level problem, which
could be exploited in global optimization algorithms. Lastly, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of the method on two example systems: the mathematical
pendulum and the compass-gait walker.

                                        <span>  In autonomous navigation, trajectory replanning, refinement, and control
command generation are essential for effective motion planning. This paper
presents a resilient approach to trajectory replanning addressing scenarios
where the initial planner's solution becomes infeasible. The proposed method
incorporates a hybrid A* algorithm to generate feasible trajectories when the
primary planner fails and applies a soft constraints-based smoothing technique
to refine these trajectories, ensuring continuity, obstacle avoidance, and
kinematic feasibility. Obstacle constraints are modelled using a dynamic
Voronoi map to improve navigation through narrow passages. This approach
enhances the consistency of trajectory planning, speeds up convergence, and
meets real-time computational requirements. In environments with around 30\% or
higher obstacle density, the ratio of free space before and after placing new
obstacles, the Resilient Timed Elastic Band (RTEB) planner achieves
approximately 20\% reduction in traverse distance, traverse time, and control
effort compared to the Timed Elastic Band (TEB) planner and Nonlinear Model
Predictive Control (NMPC) planner. These improvements demonstrate the RTEB
planner's potential for application in field robotics, particularly in
agricultural and industrial environments, where navigating unstructured terrain
is crucial for ensuring efficiency and operational resilience.

                                        <span>  Mobile target tracking is crucial in various applications such as
surveillance and autonomous navigation. This study presents a decentralized
tracking framework utilizing a Consensus-Based Estimation Filter (CBEF)
integrated with the Nearly-Constant-Velocity (NCV) model to predict a moving
target's state. The framework facilitates agents in a network to
collaboratively estimate the target's position by sharing local observations
and achieving consensus despite communication constraints and measurement
noise. A saturation-based filtering technique is employed to enhance robustness
by mitigating the impact of noisy sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed method effectively reduces the Mean Squared Estimation Error
(MSEE) over time, indicating improved estimation accuracy and reliability. The
findings underscore the effectiveness of the CBEF in decentralized
environments, highlighting its scalability and resilience in the presence of
uncertainties.

performance concerns in both finite-agent and infinite-agent (graphon)
settings. An incomplete market model is considered where agents with power
(CRRA) utility functions trade in a common risk-free bond and individual stocks
driven by both common and idiosyncratic noise. The Nash equilibrium for both
settings is characterized by forward-backward stochastic differential equations
(FBSDEs) with a quadratic growth generator, where the solution of the graphon
game leads to a novel form of infinite-dimensional McKean-Vlasov FBSDEs. Under
mild conditions, we prove the existence of Nash equilibrium for both the
graphon game and the $n$-agent game without common noise. Furthermore, we
establish a convergence result showing that, with modest assumptions on the
sensitivity matrix, as the number of agents increases, the Nash equilibrium and
associated equilibrium value of the finite-agent game converge to those of the
graphon game.

retirement decisions under exponential (CARA-type) utility. The financial
market comprises a bond with constant drift and a stock following geometric
Brownian motion. The agent receives continuous income, consumes over time, and
has the option to retire irreversibly, gaining increased leisure
post-retirement compared to pre-retirement. The objective is to maximize the
expected exponential utility of weighted consumption and leisure over an
infinite horizon. Using a martingale approach and dual value function, we
derive implicit solutions for the optimal portfolio, consumption, and
retirement time. The analysis highlights key contributions: first, the
equivalent condition for no retirement is characterized by a specific income
threshold; second, the influence of income and leisure levels on optimal
portfolio, consumption, and retirement decisions is thoroughly examined. These
results provide valuable insights into the interplay between financial and
lifestyle choices in retirement planning.

a model averaging technique. While the Koopman operator has been used for
data-driven modeling and control of nonlinear dynamics, it is challenging to
accurately reconstruct unknown dynamics from data and perform different
decision-making tasks, mainly due to its infinite dimensionality and difficulty
of finding invariant subspaces. We utilize ideas from a Bayesian
inference-based model averaging technique to devise a data-driven method that
first populates multiple Koopman models starting with a feature extraction
using neural networks and then computes point estimates of the posterior of
predicted variables. Although each model in the ensemble is not likely to be
accurate enough for a wide range of operating points or unseen data, the
proposed weighted linear embedding model combines the outputs of model ensemble
aiming at compensating the modeling error of each model so that the overall
performance will be improved.

Control (MPC) using Koopman operators. While MPC is ubiquitous in various
fields of engineering, the controller performance can deteriorate if the
modeling error between the control model and the true dynamics persists, which
may often be the case with complex nonlinear dynamics. Adaptive MPC techniques
learn models online such that the controller can compensate for the modeling
error by incorporating newly available data. We utilize the Koopman operator
framework to formulate an adaptive MPC technique that corrects for model
discrepancies in a computationally efficient manner by virtue of convex
optimization. With the use of neural networks to learn embedding spaces,
Koopman operator models enable accurate dynamics modeling. Such complex model
forms, however, often lead to unstable online learning. To this end, the
proposed method utilizes the soft update of target networks, a technique used
in stabilization of model learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Also, we
provide a discussion on which parameters to be chosen as online updated
parameters based on a specific description of linear embedding models.
Numerical simulations on a canonical nonlinear dynamical system show that the
proposed method performs favorably compared to other data-driven MPC methods
while achieving superior computational efficiency through the utilization of
Koopman operators.

                                        <span>  In this paper we provide a novel mathematical optimization based methodology
to perturb the features of a given observation to be re-classified, by a tree
ensemble classification rule, to a certain desired class. The method is based
on these facts: the most viable changes for an observation to reach the desired
class do not always coincide with the closest distance point (in the feature
space) of the target class; individuals put effort on a few number of features
to reach the desired class; and each individual is endowed with a probability
to change each of its features to a given value, which determines the overall
probability of changing to the target class. Putting all together, we provide
different methods to find the features where the individuals must exert effort
to maximize the probability to reach the target class. Our method also allows
us to rank the most important features in the tree-ensemble. The proposed
methodology is tested on a real dataset, validating the proposal.

                                        <span>  The need to control the residual of a potentially nonlinear function
$\mathcal{F}$ arises in several situations in mathematics. For example,
computing the zeros of a given map, or the reduction of some cost function
during an optimization process are such situations. In this note, we discuss
the existence of a curve $t\mapsto x(t)$ in the domain of the nonlinear map
$\mathcal{F}$ leading from some initial value $x_0$ to a value $u$ such that we
are able to control the residual $\mathcal{F}(x(t))$ based on the value
$\mathcal{F}(x_0)$. More precisely, we slightly extend an existing result from
J.W. Neuberger by proving the existence of such a curve, assuming that the
directional derivative of $\mathcal{F}$ can be represented by $x \mapsto
\mathcal{A}(x)\mathcal{F}(x_0)$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is a suitable defined
operator. The presented approach covers, in case of $\mathcal{A}(x) =
-\mathsf{Id}$, some well known results from the theory of so-called continuous
Newton methods. Moreover, based on the presented results, we discover an
approximate inverse function result.

                                        <span>  Biclustering, also called co-clustering, block clustering, or two-way
clustering, involves the simultaneous clustering of both the rows and columns
of a data matrix into distinct groups, such that the rows and columns within a
group display similar patterns. As a model problem for biclustering, we
consider the $k$-densest-disjoint biclique problem, whose goal is to identify
$k$ disjoint complete bipartite subgraphs (called bicliques) of a given
weighted complete bipartite graph such that the sum of their densities is
maximized. To address this problem, we present a tailored branch-and-cut
algorithm. For the upper bound routine, we consider a semidefinite programming
relaxation and propose valid inequalities to strengthen the bound. We solve
this relaxation in a cutting-plane fashion using a first-order method. For the
lower bound, we design a maximum weight matching rounding procedure that
exploits the solution of the relaxation solved at each node. Computational
results on both synthetic and real-world instances show that the proposed
algorithm can solve instances approximately 20 times larger than those handled
by general-purpose solvers.

comonotone inclusion. In our first contribution, we extend the Extra Anchored
Gradient (EAG) algorithm, originally proposed by Yoon and Ryu (2021) for
unconstrained min-max optimization, to constrained comonotone min-max
optimization and comonotone inclusion, achieving an optimal convergence rate of
$O\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$ among all first-order methods. Additionally, we
prove that the algorithm's iterations converge to a point in the solution set.
In our second contribution, we extend the Fast Extra Gradient (FEG) algorithm,
as developed by Lee and Kim (2021), to constrained comonotone min-max
optimization and comonotone inclusion, achieving the same
$O\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$ convergence rate. This rate is applicable to the
broadest set of comonotone inclusion problems yet studied in the literature.
Our analyses are based on simple potential function arguments, which might be
useful for analyzing other accelerated algorithms.

notion of irreducibility (strong connectivity) to time-varying matrices
(networks), and we show that under these conditions, the absolute probability

(b) unique. Our results apply to both discrete-time and continuous-time

                                        <span>  Hydrogen is produced from water using renewable electricity. Unlike
electricity, hydrogen can be stored in large quantities for long periods. This
storage ability acts as a green battery, allowing solar and wind energy to be
generated and used at different times. As a result, green hydrogen plays a
central role in facilitating a climate-neutral economy. However, the logistics
for hydrogen are complex. As new hydrogen pipelines are developed for hydrogen,
there is a trend toward repurposing the natural gas network for hydrogen, due
to its economic and environmental benefits. Yet, a rapid conversion could
disrupt the balance of natural gas supply and demand. Furthermore, technical
and economic developments surrounding the transition contribute additional
complexity, which introduces uncertainty in future supply and demand levels for
both commodities. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-period
stochastic network design problem for the transition of a natural gas pipeline
network into a green hydrogen pipeline network. We develop a
progressive-hedging-based metaheuristic to solve the problem. Results
demonstrate our matheuristic is efficient, both in computation time and in
solution quality. We show that factoring in uncertainty avoids premature
expansion and ensures the development of an adequate pipeline network meeting
long-term needs. In a case study in the Northern Netherlands for Hydrogen
Energy Applications in Valley Environments for Northern Netherlands initiative,
we focus on two key scenarios: local production and importation, exploring
their impacts on performance indicators. Our case insights exemplify the solid
foundation for strategic decision-making in energy transitions through our
approach.

ordering. We are interested in finding the cutwidth of a graph, that is, the
minimum cutwidth over all orderings, which is an NP-hard problem. In order to
approximate the cutwidth of a given graph, we present a semidefinite
relaxation. We identify several classes of valid inequalities and equalities
that we use to strengthen the semidefinite relaxation. These classes are on the
one hand the well-known 3-dicycle equations and the triangle inequalities and
on the other hand we obtain inequalities from the squared linear ordering
polytope and via lifting the linear ordering polytope. The solution of the
semidefinite program serves to obtain a lower bound and also to construct a
feasible solution and thereby having an upper bound on the cutwidth.
  In order to evaluate the quality of our bounds, we perform numerical
experiments on graphs of different sizes and densities. It turns out that we
produce high quality bounds for graphs of medium size independent of their
density in reasonable time. Compared to that, obtaining bounds for dense
instances of the same quality is out of reach for solvers using integer linear
programming techniques.

                                        <span>  We propose a novel iterative framework for minimizing a proper lower
semicontinuous Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) function $\Phi$. It comprises a
Zhang-Hager (ZH-type) nonmonotone decrease condition and a relative error
condition. Hence, the sequence generated by the ZH-type nonmonotone descent
methods will fall within this framework. Any sequence conforming to this
framework is proved to converge to a critical point of $\Phi$. If in addition
$\Phi$ has the KL property of exponent $\theta\!\in(0,1)$ at the critical
point, the convergence has a linear rate for $\theta\in(0,1/2]$ and a sublinear
rate of exponent $\frac{1-\theta}{1-2\theta}$ for $\theta\in(1/2,1)$. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish the full convergence
of the iterate sequence generated by a ZH-type nonmonotone descent method for
nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems. The obtained results are also
applied to achieve the full convergence of the iterate sequences produced by
the proximal gradient method and Riemannian gradient method with the ZH-type
nonmonotone line-search.

                                        <span>  Mean field type games (MFTGs) describe Nash equilibria between large
coalitions: each coalition consists of a continuum of cooperative agents who
maximize the average reward of their coalition while interacting
non-cooperatively with a finite number of other coalitions. Although the theory
has been extensively developed, we are still lacking efficient and scalable
computational methods. Here, we develop reinforcement learning methods for such
games in a finite space setting with general dynamics and reward functions. We
start by proving that MFTG solution yields approximate Nash equilibria in
finite-size coalition games. We then propose two algorithms. The first is based
on quantization of mean-field spaces and Nash Q-learning. We provide
convergence and stability analysis. We then propose a deep reinforcement
learning algorithm, which can scale to larger spaces. Numerical experiments in
5 environments with mean-field distributions of dimension up to $200$ show the
scalability and efficiency of the proposed method.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we explore lifting Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to the
space of probability measures and consider the so-called measurized MDPs -
deterministic processes where states are probability measures on the original
state space, and actions are stochastic kernels on the original action space.
We show that measurized MDPs are a generalization of stochastic MDPs, thus the
measurized framework can be deployed without loss of fidelity. Bertsekas and
Shreve studied similar deterministic MDPs under the discounted infinite-horizon
criterion in the context of universally measurable policies. Here, we also
consider the long-run average reward case, but we cast lifted MDPs within the
semicontinuous-semicompact framework of Hern\'andez-Lerma and Lasserre. This
makes the lifted framework more accessible as it entails (i) optimal
Borel-measurable value functions and policies, (ii) reasonably mild assumptions
that are easier to verify than those in the universally-measurable framework,
and (iii) simpler proofs. In addition, we showcase the untapped potential of
lifted MDPs by demonstrating how the measurized framework enables the
incorporation of constraints and value function approximations that are not
available from the standard MDP setting. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
algebraic lifting procedure for any MDP, showing that non-deterministic
measure-valued MDPs can emerge from lifting MDPs impacted by external random
shocks.

                                        <span>  We present an adaptive trust-region method for unconstrained optimization
that allows inexact solutions to the trust-region subproblems. Our method is a
simple variant of the classical trust-region method of Sorensen [1]. The method
achieves the best possible convergence bound up to an additive log factor, for
finding an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point, i.e., $O( \Delta_f L^{1/2}
\epsilon^{-3/2}) + \tilde{O}(1)$ iterations where $L$ is the Lipschitz constant
of the Hessian, $\Delta_f$ is the optimality gap, and $\epsilon$ is the
termination tolerance for the gradient norm. This improves over existing
trust-region methods whose worst-case bound is at least a factor of $L$ worse.
We compare our performance with state-of-the-art trust-region (TRU) and cubic
regularization (ARC) methods from the GALAHAD library on the CUTEst benchmark
set on problems with more than 100 variables. We use fewer function, gradient,
and Hessian evaluations than these methods. For instance, our algorithm's
median number of gradient evaluations is $23$ compared to $36$ for TRU and $29$
for ARC.
  Compared to the conference version of this paper [2], our revised method
includes practical enhancements and a refined subproblems termination
criterion. These modifications dramatically improved performance, including an
order of magnitude reduction in the shifted geometric mean of wall-clock times.

significant challenges in degraded environments due to lacking distinct
geometric features. This paper introduces SuperLoc, a robust LiDAR localization
package that addresses key limitations in existing methods. SuperLoc features a
novel predictive alignment risk assessment technique, enabling early detection
and mitigation of potential failures before optimization. This approach
significantly improves performance in challenging scenarios such as corridors,
tunnels, and caves. Unlike existing degeneracy mitigation algorithms that rely
on post-optimization analysis and heuristic thresholds, SuperLoc evaluates the
localizability of raw sensor measurements. Experimental results demonstrate
significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods across
various degraded environments. Our approach achieves a 54% increase in accuracy
and exhibits the highest robustness. To facilitate further research, we release
our implementation along with datasets from eight challenging scenarios

                                        <span>  Unmanned and intelligent agricultural systems are crucial for enhancing
agricultural efficiency and for helping mitigate the effect of labor shortage.
However, unlike urban environments, agricultural fields impose distinct and
unique challenges on autonomous robotic systems, such as the unstructured and
dynamic nature of the environment, the rough and uneven terrain, and the
resulting non-smooth robot motion. To address these challenges, this work
introduces an adaptive LiDAR odometry and mapping framework tailored for
autonomous agricultural mobile robots operating in complex agricultural
environments. The proposed framework consists of a robust LiDAR odometry
algorithm based on dense Generalized-ICP scan matching, and an adaptive mapping
module that considers motion stability and point cloud consistency for
selective map updates. The key design principle of this framework is to
prioritize the incremental consistency of the map by rejecting motion-distorted
points and sparse dynamic objects, which in turn leads to high accuracy in
odometry estimated from scan matching against the map. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is validated via extensive evaluation against state-of-the-art
methods on field datasets collected in real-world agricultural environments
featuring various planting types, terrain types, and robot motion profiles.
Results demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate odometry estimation
and mapping results consistently and robustly across diverse agricultural
settings, whereas other methods are sensitive to abrupt robot motion and
accumulated drift in unstructured environments. Further, the computational
efficiency of our method is competitive compared with other methods. The source
code of the developed method and the associated field dataset are publicly
available at https://github.com/UCR-Robotics/AG-LOAM.

multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Our approach allows the swarm to
achieve cohesively and aligned flocking (collective motion), in a random
direction, without externally provided directional information exchange
(alignment control). The method relies on minimalistic sensory requirements as
it uses only the relative range and bearing of swarm agents in local proximity
obtained through onboard sensors on the UAV. Thus, our method is able to
stabilize and control the flock of a general shape above a steep terrain
without any explicit communication between swarm members. To implement proximal
control in a three-dimensional manner, the Lennard-Jones potential function is
used to maintain cohesiveness and avoid collisions between robots. The
performance of the proposed approach was tested in real-world conditions by
experiments with a team of nine UAVs. Experiments also present the usage of our
approach on UAVs that are independent of external positioning systems such as
the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Relying only on a relative
visual localization through the ultraviolet direction and ranging (UVDAR)
system, previously proposed by our group, the experiments verify that our
system can be applied in GNSS-denied environments. The degree achieved of
alignment and cohesiveness was evaluated using the metrics of order and
steady-state value.

                                        <span>  This paper addresses the problem of thrust estimation and control for the
rotors of small-sized multirotors Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Accurate
control of the thrust generated by each rotor during flight is one of the main
challenges for robust control of quadrotors. The most common approach is to
approximate the mapping of rotor speed to thrust with a simple quadratic model.
This model is known to fail under non-hovering flight conditions, introducing
errors into the control pipeline. One of the approaches to modeling the
aerodynamics around the propellers is the Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT).
Here, we propose a novel BEMT-based closed-loop thrust estimator and control to
eliminate the laborious calibration step of finding several aerodynamic
coefficients. We aim to reuse known values as a baseline and fit the thrust
estimate to values closest to the real ones with a simple test bench
experiment, resulting in a single scaling value. A feedforward PID thrust
control was implemented for each rotor, and the methods were validated by
outdoor experiments with two multirotor UAV platforms: 250mm and 500mm. A
statistical analysis of the results showed that the thrust estimation and
control provided better robustness under aerodynamically varying flight
conditions compared to the quadratic model.

complex command (action) classification is still an open problem that usually
prevents the real applicability of such a technique. The literature presents
some works that use neural networks to detect these actions. However, occlusion
is still a major issue in HRI, especially when using uncrewed aerial vehicles
(UAVs), since, during the robot's movement, the human operator is often out of
the robot's field of view. Furthermore, in multi-robot scenarios, distributed
training is also an open problem. In this sense, this work proposes an action
recognition and control approach based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Deep
Neural Networks with two layers in association with three densely connected
layers and Federated Learning (FL) embedded in multiple drones. The FL enabled
our approach to be trained in a distributed fashion, i.e., access to data
without the need for cloud or other repositories, which facilitates the
multi-robot system's learning. Furthermore, our multi-robot approach results
also prevented occlusion situations, with experiments with real robots
achieving an accuracy greater than 96%.

                                        <span>  Precise manipulation of liquid marbles has significant potential in various
applications such as lab-on-a-chip systems, drug delivery, and biotechnology
and has been a challenge for researchers. Ferrofluid marble (FM) is a marble
with a ferrofluid core that can easily be manipulated by a magnetic field.
Although FMs have great potential for accurate positioning and manipulation,
these marbles have not been precisely controlled in magnetic digital
microfluidics, so far. In this study for the first time, a novel method of
magnetic actuation is proposed using a pair of Helmholtz coils and permanent
magnets. The governing equations for controlling the FM position are
investigated, and it is shown that there are three different strategies for
adjusting the applied magnetic force. Then, experiments are conducted to
demonstrate the capability of the proposed method. To this aim, different
magnetic setups are proposed for manipulating FMs. These setups are compared in
terms of energy consumption and tracking ability across various frequencies.
The study showcases several applications of precise FM position control,
including controllable reciprocal positioning, simultaneous position control of
two FMs, the transport of non-magnetic liquid marbles using the FMs, and sample
extraction method from the liquid core of the FM.

overfit to specific environments or datasets. Consequently, they excel within
their training distribution but face challenges in generalizing to novel or
unforeseen scenarios. This paper presents a method to proactively identify
failure mode probabilities in robot manipulation policies, providing insights
into where these models are likely to falter. To this end, since exhaustively
searching over a large space of failures is infeasible, we propose a deep
reinforcement learning-based framework, RoboFail. It is designed to detect
scenarios prone to failure and quantify their likelihood, thus offering a
structured approach to anticipate failures. By identifying these high-risk
states in advance, RoboFail enables researchers and engineers to better
understand the robustness limits of robot policies, contributing to the
development of safer and more adaptable robotic systems.

perform tasks in open-world environments have the potential to significantly
impact labor tasks like manufacturing or in-home care -- benefiting the lives
of those who come to depend on them. In this work, we consider how this benefit
might be hijacked by local modifications in the appearance of the agent's
operating environment. Specifically, we take the popular Vision-and-Language
Navigation (VLN) task as a representative setting and develop a whitebox
adversarial attack that optimizes a 3D attack object's appearance to induce
desired behaviors in pretrained VLN agents that observe it in the environment.
We demonstrate that the proposed attack can cause VLN agents to ignore their
instructions and execute alternative actions after encountering the attack
object -- even for instructions and agent paths not considered when optimizing
the attack. For these novel settings, we find our attacks can induce
early-termination behaviors or divert an agent along an attacker-defined
multi-step trajectory. Under both conditions, environmental attacks
significantly reduce agent capabilities to successfully follow user
instructions.

estimation problem of a rigid-body moving in three-dimensional (3D) space with
six degrees-of-freedom (6 DoF). The highly nonlinear navigation kinematics are
formulated to ensure global representation of the navigation problem. A
computationally efficient Quaternion-based Navigation Unscented Kalman Filter
(QNUKF) is proposed on $\mathbb{S}^{3}\times\mathbb{R}^{3}\times\mathbb{R}^{3}$
imitating the true nonlinear navigation kinematics and utilize onboard
Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) units to achieve successful GPS-denied
navigation. The proposed QNUKF is designed in discrete form to operate based on
the data fusion of photographs garnered by a vision unit (stereo or monocular
camera) and information collected by a low-cost inertial measurement unit
(IMU). The photographs are processed to extract feature points in 3D space,
while the 6-axis IMU supplies angular velocity and accelerometer measurements
expressed with respect to the body-frame. Robustness and effectiveness of the
proposed QNUKF have been confirmed through experiments on a real-world dataset
collected by a drone navigating in 3D and consisting of stereo images and
6-axis IMU measurements. Also, the proposed approach is validated against
standard state-of-the-art filtering techniques. IEEE Keywords: Localization,

dexterous robotic grasping that simplifies training while enhancing scalability
and performance. Unlike prior methods such as UniDexGrasp++, which require
complex, multi-step training pipelines, UniGraspTransformer follows a
streamlined process: first, dedicated policy networks are trained for
individual objects using reinforcement learning to generate successful grasp
trajectories; then, these trajectories are distilled into a single, universal
network. Our approach enables UniGraspTransformer to scale effectively,
incorporating up to 12 self-attention blocks for handling thousands of objects
with diverse poses. Additionally, it generalizes well to both idealized and
real-world inputs, evaluated in state-based and vision-based settings. Notably,
UniGraspTransformer generates a broader range of grasping poses for objects in
various shapes and orientations, resulting in more diverse grasp strategies.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over
state-of-the-art, UniDexGrasp++, across various object categories, achieving
success rate gains of 3.5%, 7.7%, and 10.1% on seen objects, unseen objects
within seen categories, and completely unseen objects, respectively, in the
vision-based setting. Project page:

                                        <span>  The end-to-end autonomous driving paradigm has recently attracted lots of
attention due to its scalability. However, existing methods are constrained by
the limited scale of real-world data, which hinders a comprehensive exploration
of the scaling laws associated with end-to-end autonomous driving. To address
this issue, we collected substantial data from various driving scenarios and
behaviors and conducted an extensive study on the scaling laws of existing
imitation learning-based end-to-end autonomous driving paradigms. Specifically,
approximately 4 million demonstrations from 23 different scenario types were
gathered, amounting to over 30,000 hours of driving demonstrations. We
performed open-loop evaluations and closed-loop simulation evaluations in 1,400
diverse driving demonstrations (1,300 for open-loop and 100 for closed-loop)
under stringent assessment conditions. Through experimental analysis, we
discovered that (1) the performance of the driving model exhibits a power-law
relationship with the amount of training data; (2) a small increase in the
quantity of long-tailed data can significantly improve the performance for the
corresponding scenarios; (3) appropriate scaling of data enables the model to
achieve combinatorial generalization in novel scenes and actions. Our results
highlight the critical role of data scaling in improving the generalizability
of models across diverse autonomous driving scenarios, assuring safe deployment
in the real world. Project repository:

                                        <span>  Contact-rich bimanual manipulation involves precise coordination of two arms
to change object states through strategically selected contacts and motions.
Due to the inherent complexity of these tasks, acquiring sufficient
demonstration data and training policies that generalize to unseen scenarios
remain a largely unresolved challenge. Building on recent advances in planning
through contacts, we introduce Generalizable Planning-Guided Diffusion Policy
Learning (GLIDE), an approach that effectively learns to solve contact-rich
bimanual manipulation tasks by leveraging model-based motion planners to
generate demonstration data in high-fidelity physics simulation. Through
efficient planning in randomized environments, our approach generates
large-scale and high-quality synthetic motion trajectories for tasks involving
diverse objects and transformations. We then train a task-conditioned diffusion
policy via behavior cloning using these demonstrations. To tackle the
sim-to-real gap, we propose a set of essential design options in feature
extraction, task representation, action prediction, and data augmentation that
enable learning robust prediction of smooth action sequences and generalization
to unseen scenarios. Through experiments in both simulation and the real world,
we demonstrate that our approach can enable a bimanual robotic system to
effectively manipulate objects of diverse geometries, dimensions, and physical
properties. Website: https://glide-manip.github.io/

for improving human-robot interaction and enabling complex operations in
dynamic environments. While large language models (LLMs) are not inherently
designed for planning, they can significantly enhance planning efficiency by
providing guidance and informing constraints to ensure safety. This paper
introduces a planning framework that integrates LLMs with 2D occupancy grid
maps and natural language commands to improve spatial reasoning and task
execution in resource-limited settings. By decomposing high-level commands and
real-time environmental data, the system generates structured navigation plans
for pick-and-place tasks, including obstacle avoidance, goal prioritization,
and adaptive behaviors. The framework dynamically recalculates paths to address
environmental changes and aligns with implicit social norms for seamless
human-robot interaction. Our results demonstrates the potential of LLMs to
design context-aware system to enhance navigation efficiency and safety in
industrial and dynamic environments.

                                        <span>  Torque and continuous rotation are fundamental methods of actuation and
manipulation in rigid robots. Soft robot arms use soft materials and structures
to mimic the passive compliance of biological arms that bend and extend. This
use of compliance prevents soft arms from continuously transmitting and
exerting torques to interact with their environment. Here, we show how relying
on patterning structures instead of inherent material properties allows soft
robotic arms to remain compliant while continuously transmitting torque to
their environment. We demonstrate a soft robotic arm made from a pair of
mechanical metamaterials that act as compliant constant-velocity joints. The
joints are up to 52 times stiffer in torsion than bending and can bend up to
45{\deg}. This robot arm can continuously transmit torque while deforming in
all other directions. The arm's mechanical design achieves high motion
repeatability (0.4 mm and 0.1{\deg}) when tracking trajectories. We then
trained a neural network to learn the inverse kinematics, enabling us to
program the arm to complete tasks that are challenging for existing soft robots
such as installing light bulbs, fastening bolts, and turning valves. The arm's
passive compliance makes it safe around humans and provides a source of
mechanical intelligence, enabling it to adapt to misalignment when manipulating
objects. This work will bridge the gap between hard and soft robotics with
applications in human assistance, warehouse automation, and extreme
environments.

Existing methods often struggle with sparse and incomplete point cloud
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimodal-guided Virtual
Cues Projection (MVCP) scheme that generates virtual cues to enrich sparse
point clouds. Additionally, we introduce an enhanced tracker MVCTrack based on
the generated virtual cues. Specifically, the MVCP scheme seamlessly integrates
RGB sensors into LiDAR-based systems, leveraging a set of 2D detections to
create dense 3D virtual cues that significantly improve the sparsity of point
clouds. These virtual cues can naturally integrate with existing LiDAR-based 3D
trackers, yielding substantial performance gains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance on the NuScenes
dataset.

applications, either where it is convenient to keep the human inside the
control loop, or to train advanced robot agents. So far, this technology has
been used in combination with camera systems with remarkable success. On the
other hand, only a limited number of studies have focused on leveraging haptic
feedback from tactile sensors in contexts where camera-based systems fail, such
as due to self-occlusions or poor light conditions like smoke. This study
demonstrates the feasibility of precise pick-and-place teleoperation without
cameras by leveraging tactile-based 3D object reconstruction in VR and
providing haptic feedback to a blindfolded user. Our preliminary results show
that integrating these technologies enables the successful completion of
telemanipulation tasks previously dependent on cameras, paving the way for more
complex future applications.

plays a pivotal role in several applications, from healthcare to operations in
harsh environments. While visual feedback from cameras can provide valuable
information to the human operator, haptic feedback is essential for accessing
specific object properties that are difficult to be perceived by vision, such
as stiffness. For the first time, we present a participant study demonstrating
that operators can perceive the stiffness of remote objects during real-world
telemanipulation with a dexterous robotic hand, when haptic feedback is
generated from tactile sensing fingertips. Participants were tasked with
squeezing soft objects by teleoperating a robotic hand, using two methods of
haptic feedback: one based solely on the measured contact force, while the
second also includes the squeezing displacement between the leader and follower
devices. Our results demonstrate that operators are indeed capable of
discriminating objects of different stiffness, relying on haptic feedback alone
and without any visual feedback. Additionally, our findings suggest that the
displacement feedback component may enhance discrimination with objects of
similar stiffness.

revolutionizing transportation, yet ensuring their safety and reliability
remains a critical challenge, especially when exposed to dynamic and
unpredictable environments. Real-world testing of an Autonomous Driving System
(ADS) is both expensive and risky, making simulation-based testing a preferred
approach. In this paper, we propose AVASTRA, a Reinforcement Learning
(RL)-based approach to generate realistic critical scenarios for testing ADSs
in simulation environments. To capture the complexity of driving scenarios,
AVASTRA comprehensively represents the environment by both the internal states
of an ADS under-test (e.g., the status of the ADS's core components, speed, or
acceleration) and the external states of the surrounding factors in the
simulation environment (e.g., weather, traffic flow, or road condition).
AVASTRA trains the RL agent to effectively configure the simulation environment
that places the AV in dangerous situations and potentially leads it to
collisions. We introduce a diverse set of actions that allows the RL agent to
systematically configure both environmental conditions and traffic
participants. Additionally, based on established safety requirements, we
enforce heuristic constraints to ensure the realism and relevance of the
generated test scenarios. AVASTRA is evaluated on two popular simulation maps
with four different road configurations. Our results show AVASTRA's ability to
outperform the state-of-the-art approach by generating 30% to 115% more
collision scenarios. Compared to the baseline based on Random Search, AVASTRA
achieves up to 275% better performance. These results highlight the
effectiveness of AVASTRA in enhancing the safety testing of AVs through
realistic comprehensive critical scenario generation.

                                        <span>  Autonomous agents operating in adversarial scenarios face a fundamental
challenge: while they may know their adversaries' high-level objectives, such
as reaching specific destinations within time constraints, the exact policies
these adversaries will employ remain unknown. Traditional approaches address
this challenge by treating the adversary's state as a partially observable
element, leading to a formulation as a Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP). However, the induced belief-space dynamics in a POMDP require
knowledge of the system's transition dynamics, which, in this case, depend on
the adversary's unknown policy. Our key observation is that while an
adversary's exact policy is unknown, their behavior is necessarily constrained
by their mission objectives and the physical environment, allowing us to
characterize the space of possible behaviors without assuming specific
policies. In this paper, we develop Task-Aware Behavior Fields (TAB-Fields), a
representation that captures adversary state distributions over time by
computing the most unbiased probability distribution consistent with known
constraints. We construct TAB-Fields by solving a constrained optimization
problem that minimizes additional assumptions about adversary behavior beyond
mission and environmental requirements. We integrate TAB-Fields with standard
planning algorithms by introducing TAB-conditioned POMCP, an adaptation of
Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning. Through experiments in simulation
with underwater robots and hardware implementations with ground robots, we
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to
baselines that either assume specific adversary policies or neglect mission
constraints altogether. Evaluation videos and code are available at

                                        <span>  Modern unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are irreplaceable in search and rescue
(SAR) missions to obtain a situational overview or provide closeups without
endangering personnel. However, UAVs heavily rely on global navigation
satellite system (GNSS) for localization which works well in open spaces, but
the precision drastically degrades in the vicinity of buildings. These
inaccuracies hinder aggregation of diverse data from multiple sources in a
unified georeferenced frame for SAR operators. In contrast, CityGML models
provide approximate building shapes with accurate georeferenced poses. Besides,
LiDAR works best in the vicinity of 3D structures. Hence, we refine coarse GNSS
measurements by registering LiDAR maps against CityGML and digital elevation
map (DEM) models as a prior for allocentric mapping. An intuitive plausibility
score selects the best hypothesis based on occupancy using a 2D height map.
Afterwards, we integrate the registration results in a continuous-time
spline-based pose graph optimizer with LiDAR odometry and further sensing
modalities to obtain globally consistent, georeferenced trajectories and maps.
We evaluate the viability of our approach on multiple flights captured at two
distinct testing sites. Our method successfully reduced GNSS offset errors from
up-to 16 m to below 0.5 m on multiple flights. Furthermore, we obtain globally
consistent maps w.r.t. prior 3D geospatial models.

                                        <span>  Robust Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a crucial enabler for
autonomous navigation in natural, unstructured environments such as parks and
gardens. However, these environments present unique challenges for SLAM due to
frequent seasonal changes, varying light conditions, and dense vegetation.
These factors often degrade the performance of visual SLAM algorithms
originally developed for structured urban environments. To address this gap, we
present ROVER, a comprehensive benchmark dataset tailored for evaluating visual
SLAM algorithms under diverse environmental conditions and spatial
configurations. We captured the dataset with a robotic platform equipped with
monocular, stereo, and RGB-D cameras, as well as inertial sensors. It covers 39
recordings across five outdoor locations, collected through all seasons and
various lighting scenarios, i.e., day, dusk, and night with and without
external lighting. With this novel dataset, we evaluate several traditional and
deep learning-based SLAM methods and study their performance in diverse
challenging conditions. The results demonstrate that while stereo-inertial and
RGB-D configurations generally perform better under favorable lighting and
moderate vegetation, most SLAM systems perform poorly in low-light and
high-vegetation scenarios, particularly during summer and autumn. Our analysis
highlights the need for improved adaptability in visual SLAM algorithms for
outdoor applications, as current systems struggle with dynamic environmental
factors affecting scale, feature extraction, and trajectory consistency. This
dataset provides a solid foundation for advancing visual SLAM research in
real-world, natural environments, fostering the development of more resilient
SLAM systems for long-term outdoor localization and mapping. The dataset and
the code of the benchmark are available under

applications. Early dynamic mapping methods focused on mitigating the negative
influence of short-term dynamic objects on camera motion estimation by masking
or tracking specific categories, which often fall short in adapting to
long-term scene changes. Recent efforts address object association in long-term
dynamic environments using neural networks trained on synthetic datasets, but
they still rely on predefined object shapes and categories. Other methods
incorporate visual, geometric, or semantic heuristics for the association but
often lack robustness. In this work, we introduce BYE, a class-agnostic,
per-scene point cloud encoder that removes the need for predefined categories,
shape priors, or extensive association datasets. Trained on only a single
sequence of exploration data, BYE can efficiently perform object association in
dynamically changing scenes. We further propose an ensembling scheme combining
the semantic strengths of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the scene-specific
expertise of BYE, achieving a 7% improvement and a 95% success rate in object
association tasks. Code and dataset are available at

utilized by schools of sardines, swarms of bees, and other large groups of
animals capable of moving in a decentralized yet coherent manner, our method
does not rely on detecting individual neighbors by each agent and estimating
their relative position, but rather we propose to regress a neighbor density
over distance. This allows for a more accurate distance estimation as well as
better scalability with respect to the number of neighbors. Additionally, a
novel swarm control algorithm is proposed to make it compatible with the new
relative localization method. We provide a thorough evaluation of the presented
methods and demonstrate that the regressing approach to distance estimation is
more robust to varying relative pose of the targets and that it is suitable to
be used as the main source of relative localization for swarm stabilization.

environments. Whereas the forelimbs evolved into wings primarily for flight,
the hindlimbs serve diverse functions such as walking, hopping, and leaping,
and jumping take-off for transitions into flight. These capabilities have
inspired engineers to aim for similar multi-modality in aerial robots,
expanding their range of applications across diverse environments. However,
challenges remain in reproducing multi-modal locomotion, across gaits with
distinct kinematics and propulsive characteristics, such as walking and
jumping, while preserving lightweight mass for flight. This tradeoff between
mechanical complexity and versatility limits most existing aerial robots to
only one additional locomotor mode. Here, we overcome the
complexity-versatility tradeoff with RAVEN (Robotic Avian-inspired Vehicle for
multiple ENvironments), which uses its bird-inspired multi-functional legs to
jump rapidly into flight, walk on ground and hop over obstacles and gaps
similar to the multi-modal locomotion of birds. We show that jumping for
take-off contributes substantially to initial flight take-off speed and,
remarkably, that it is more energy-efficient than solely propeller-based
take-off. Our analysis suggests an important tradeoff in mass distribution
between legs and body among birds adapted for different locomotor strategies,
with greater investment in leg mass among terrestrial birds with multi-modal
gait demands. Multi-functional robot legs expand opportunities to deploy
traditional fixed-wing aircraft in complex terrains through autonomous

                                        <span>  Accurate grasp force control is one of the key skills for ensuring successful
and damage-free robotic grasping of objects. Although existing methods have
conducted in-depth research on slip detection and grasping force planning, they
often overlook the issue of adaptive tracking of the actual force to the target
force when handling objects with different material properties. The optimal
parameters of a force tracking controller are significantly influenced by the
object's stiffness, and many adaptive force tracking algorithms rely on
stiffness estimation. However, real-world objects often exhibit viscous,
plastic, or other more complex nonlinear time-varying behaviors, and existing
studies provide insufficient support for these materials in terms of stiffness
definition and estimation. To address this, this paper introduces the concept
of generalized stiffness, extending the definition of stiffness to nonlinear
time-varying grasp system models, and proposes an online generalized stiffness
estimator based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Based on generalized
stiffness, this paper proposes an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy using
a PI controller as an example, enabling dynamic force tracking for objects with
varying characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves high precision and short probing time, while showing better
adaptability to non-ideal objects compared to existing methods. The method
effectively solves the problem of grasp force tracking in unknown, nonlinear,
and time-varying grasp systems, enhancing the robotic grasping ability in
unstructured environments.

                                        <span>  In self-supervised robot learning, robots actively explore their environments
and generate data by acting on entities in the environment. Therefore, an
exploration policy is desired that ensures sample efficiency to minimize robot
execution costs while still providing accurate learning. For this purpose, the
robotic community has adopted Intrinsic Motivation (IM)-based approaches such
as Learning Progress (LP). On the machine learning front, Active Learning (AL)
has been used successfully, especially for classification tasks. In this work,
we develop a novel AL framework geared towards robotics regression tasks, such
as action-effect prediction and, more generally, for world model learning,
which we call MUSEL - Model Uncertainty for Sample Efficient Learning. MUSEL
aims to extract model uncertainty from the total uncertainty estimate given by
a suitable learning engine by making use of earning progress and input
diversity and use it to improve sample efficiency beyond the state-of-the-art
action-effect prediction methods. We demonstrate the feasibility of our model
by using a Stochastic Variational Gaussian Process (SVGP) as the learning
engine and testing the system on a set of robotic experiments in simulation.
The efficacy of MUSEL is demonstrated by comparing its performance to standard
methods used in robot action-effect learning. In a robotic tabletop environment
in which a robot manipulator is tasked with learning the effect of its actions,
the experiments show that MUSEL facilitates higher accuracy in learning action
effects while ensuring sample efficiency.

informative path planning with heterogeneous fleets of autonomous surface
vehicles to locate and collect plastic waste. The system employs two teams of
vehicles: scouts and cleaners. Coordination between these teams is achieved
through a deep reinforcement approach, allowing agents to learn strategies to
maximize cleaning efficiency. The primary objective is for the scout team to
provide an up-to-date contamination model, while the cleaner team collects as
much waste as possible following this model. This strategy leads to
heterogeneous teams that optimize fleet efficiency through inter-team
cooperation supported by a tailored reward function. Different trainings of the
proposed algorithm are compared with other state-of-the-art heuristics in two
distinct scenarios, one with high convexity and another with narrow corridors
and challenging access. According to the obtained results, it is demonstrated
that deep reinforcement learning based algorithms outperform other benchmark
heuristics, exhibiting superior adaptability. In addition, training with greedy
actions further enhances performance, particularly in scenarios with intricate
layouts.

                                        <span>  Tracking the 6DoF pose of unknown objects in monocular RGB video sequences is
crucial for robotic manipulation. However, existing approaches typically rely
on accurate depth information, which is non-trivial to obtain in real-world
scenarios. Although depth estimation algorithms can be employed, geometric
inaccuracy can lead to failures in RGBD-based pose tracking methods. To address
this challenge, we introduce GSGTrack, a novel RGB-based pose tracking
framework that jointly optimizes geometry and pose. Specifically, we adopt 3D
Gaussian Splatting to create an optimizable 3D representation, which is learned
simultaneously with a graph-based geometry optimization to capture the object's
appearance features and refine its geometry. However, the joint optimization
process is susceptible to perturbations from noisy pose and geometry data.
Thus, we propose an object silhouette loss to address the issue of pixel-wise
loss being overly sensitive to pose noise during tracking. To mitigate the
geometric ambiguities caused by inaccurate depth information, we propose a
geometry-consistent image pair selection strategy, which filters out
low-confidence pairs and ensures robust geometric optimization. Extensive
experiments on the OnePose and HO3D datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
GSGTrack in both 6DoF pose tracking and object reconstruction.

great potential for scene reconstruction. Recent studies have expanded their
applications in autonomous reconstruction through task assignment methods.
However, these methods are mainly limited to single robot, and rapid
reconstruction of large-scale scenes remains challenging. Additionally,
task-driven planning based on surface uncertainty is prone to being trapped in
local optima. To this end, we propose the first 3DGS-based centralized
multi-robot autonomous 3D reconstruction framework. To further reduce time cost
of task generation and improve reconstruction quality, we integrate online
open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with surface uncertainty of 3DGS,
focusing view sampling on regions with high instance uncertainty. Finally, we
develop a multi-robot collaboration strategy with mode and task assignments
improving reconstruction quality while ensuring planning efficiency. Our method
demonstrates the highest reconstruction quality among all planning methods and
superior planning efficiency compared to existing multi-robot methods. We
deploy our method on multiple robots, and results show that it can effectively
plan view paths and reconstruct scenes with high quality.

robots. In recent years, approaches using diffusion models have emerged,
significantly improving training stability and generation quality. Despite the
success of diffusion models, generating high-quality samples requires numerous
iterations of running neural networks, and the increasing computational cost
can pose a barrier to robotics applications. To address this challenge, this
paper presents R2Flow, a fast and high-fidelity generative model for LiDAR
data. Our method is based on rectified flows that learn straight trajectories,
simulating data generation with much fewer sampling steps against diffusion
models. We also propose a efficient Transformer-based model architecture for
processing the image representation of LiDAR range and reflectance
measurements. Our experiments on the unconditional generation of the KITTI-360

                                        <span>  This paper introduces SmartBSP, an advanced self-supervised learning
framework for real-time path planning and obstacle avoidance in autonomous
robotics navigating through complex environments. The proposed system
integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN) and Actor-Critic architecture to process limited LIDAR inputs
and compute spatial decision-making probabilities. The robot's perceptual field
is discretized into a grid format, which the CNN analyzes to produce a spatial
probability distribution. During the training process a nuanced cost function
is minimized that accounts for path curvature, endpoint proximity, and obstacle
avoidance. Simulations results in different scenarios validate the algorithm's
resilience and adaptability across diverse operational scenarios. Subsequently,
Real-time experiments, employing the Robot Operating System (ROS), were carried
out to assess the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

                                        <span>  Estimating the probability of failure is a critical step in developing
safety-critical autonomous systems. Direct estimation methods such as Monte
Carlo sampling are often impractical due to the rarity of failures in these
systems. Existing importance sampling approaches do not scale to sequential
decision-making systems with large state spaces and long horizons. We propose
an adaptive importance sampling algorithm to address these limitations. Our
method minimizes the forward Kullback-Leibler divergence between a
state-dependent proposal distribution and a relaxed form of the optimal
importance sampling distribution. Our method uses Markov score ascent methods
to estimate this objective. We evaluate our approach on four sequential systems
and show that it provides more accurate failure probability estimates than
baseline Monte Carlo and importance sampling techniques. This work is open

are instructed using human language to grasp specific objects. However,
existing methods often depend on dense camera views and struggle to quickly
update scenes, limiting their effectiveness in changeable environments.
  In contrast, we propose SparseGrasp, a novel open-vocabulary robotic grasping
system that operates efficiently with sparse-view RGB images and handles scene
updates fastly. Our system builds upon and significantly enhances existing
computer vision modules in robotic learning. Specifically, SparseGrasp utilizes
DUSt3R to generate a dense point cloud as the initialization for 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), maintaining high fidelity even under sparse supervision.
Importantly, SparseGrasp incorporates semantic awareness from recent vision
foundation models. To further improve processing efficiency, we repurpose
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to compress features from 2D models.
Additionally, we introduce a novel render-and-compare strategy that ensures
rapid scene updates, enabling multi-turn grasping in changeable environments.
  Experimental results show that SparseGrasp significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of both speed and adaptability, providing a
robust solution for multi-turn grasping in changeable environment.

                                        <span>  Granular materials (GMs) are ubiquitous in daily life. Understanding their
properties is also important, especially in agriculture and industry. However,
existing works require dedicated measurement equipment and also need large
human efforts to handle a large number of particles. In this paper, we
introduce a method for estimating the relative values of particle size and
density from the video of the interaction with GMs. It is trained on a
visuo-haptic learning framework inspired by a contact model, which reveals the
strong correlation between GM properties and the visual-haptic data during the
probe-dragging in the GMs. After training, the network can map the visual
modality well to the haptic signal and implicitly characterize the relative
distribution of particle properties in its latent embeddings, as interpreted in
that contact model. Therefore, we can analyze GM properties using the trained
encoder, and only visual information is needed without extra sensory modalities
and human efforts for labeling. The presented GM property estimator has been
extensively validated via comparison and ablation experiments. The
generalization capability has also been evaluated and a real-world application
on the beach is also demonstrated. Experiment videos are available at

recent advancements in Neural Implicit Representations (NIR), existing methods
often lack editability and compositional flexibility, limiting their use in
scenarios requiring high interactivity and object-level manipulation. In this
paper, we introduce the Gaussian Object Carver (GOC), a novel, efficient, and
scalable framework for object-compositional 3D scene reconstruction. GOC
leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), enriched with monocular geometry priors
and multi-view geometry regularization, to achieve high-quality and flexible
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a zero-shot Object Surface Completion
(OSC) model, which uses 3D priors from 3d object data to reconstruct unobserved
surfaces, ensuring object completeness even in occluded areas. Experimental
results demonstrate that GOC improves reconstruction efficiency and geometric
fidelity. It holds promise for advancing the practical application of digital
twins in embodied AI, AR/VR, and interactive simulation environments.

manipulation. In this work, we leverage a multimodal visuotactile sensor within
the framework of imitation learning (IL) to perform contact-rich tasks that
involve relative motion (e.g., slipping and sliding) between the end-effector
and the manipulated object. We introduce two algorithmic contributions, tactile
force matching and learned mode switching, as complimentary methods for
improving IL. Tactile force matching enhances kinesthetic teaching by reading
approximate forces during the demonstration and generating an adapted robot
trajectory that recreates the recorded forces. Learned mode switching uses IL
to couple visual and tactile sensor modes with the learned motion policy,
simplifying the transition from reaching to contacting. We perform robotic
manipulation experiments on four door-opening tasks with a variety of
observation and algorithm configurations to study the utility of multimodal
visuotactile sensing and our proposed improvements. Our results show that the
inclusion of force matching raises average policy success rates by 62.5%,
visuotactile mode switching by 30.3%, and visuotactile data as a policy input
by 42.5%, emphasizing the value of see-through tactile sensing for IL, both for
data collection to allow force matching, and for policy execution to enable
accurate task feedback. Project site: https://papers.starslab.ca/sts-il .

of humans toward robots. In addition, teleoperating robotic arms can be
challenging for non-experts. To reduce the strain put on the user, we created
TELESIM, a modular and plug-and-play framework that enables direct
teleoperation of any robotic arm using a digital twin as the interface between
users and the robotic system. We evaluated our framework using a user survey
with three robots and control methods and recorded the user's workload and
performance at completing a tower stacking task. However, an analysis of the
strain on the user and their ability to trust robots was omitted. This paper
addresses these omissions by presenting the additional results of our user
survey of 37 participants carried out in United Kingdom. In addition, we
present the results of an additional user survey, under similar conditions
performed in Japan, with the goal of addressing the limitations of our previous
approach, by interfacing a VR controller with a UR5e. Our experimental results
show that the UR5e has more towers built. Additionally, the UR5e gives the
least amount of cognitive stress, while the combination of Senseglove and UR3
provides the user with the highest physical strain and causes the user to feel
more frustrated. Finally, the Japanese participants seem more trusting of

                                        <span>  Human-robot interaction will play an essential role in various industries and
daily tasks, enabling robots to effectively collaborate with humans and reduce
their physical workload. Most of the existing approaches for physical
human-robot interaction focus on collaboration between a human and a single
ground or aerial robot. In recent years, very little progress has been made in
this research area when considering multiple aerial robots, which offer
increased versatility and mobility. This paper proposes a novel approach for
physical human-robot collaborative transportation and manipulation of a
cable-suspended payload with multiple aerial robots. The proposed method
enables smooth and intuitive interaction between the transported objects and a
human worker. In the same time, we consider distance constraints during the
operations by exploiting the internal redundancy of the multi-robot
transportation system. The key elements of our approach are (a) a collaborative
payload external wrench estimator that does not rely on any force sensor; (b) a
6D admittance controller for human-aerial-robot collaborative transportation
and manipulation; (c) a human-aware force distribution that exploits the
internal system redundancy to guarantee the execution of additional tasks such
inter-human-robot separation without affecting the payload trajectory tracking
or quality of interaction. We validate the approach through extensive
simulation and real-world experiments. These include scenarios where the robot
team assists the human in transporting and manipulating a load, or where the
human helps the robot team navigate the environment. We experimentally
demonstrate for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that our approach
enables a quadrotor team to physically collaborate with a human in manipulating
a payload in all 6 DoF in collaborative human-robot transportation and
manipulation tasks.

automatically find optimal and innovative solutions for challenging tasks in
complex environments. The vast search-space includes the physical design-space
and the controller parameter-space, making it a challenging problem in machine
learning and optimisation in general. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have shown
promising results in generating robot designs via gradient-free optimisation.
Morpho-evolution with learning (MEL) uses EAs to concurrently generate robot
designs and learn the optimal parameters of the controllers. Two main issues
prevent MEL from scaling to higher complexity tasks: computational cost and
premature convergence to sub-optimal designs. To address these issues, we
propose combining morpho-evolution with intrinsic motivations. Intrinsically
motivated behaviour arises from embodiment and simple learning rules without
external guidance. We use a homeokinetic controller that generates exploratory
behaviour in a few seconds with reduced knowledge of the robot's design.
Homeokinesis replaces costly learning phases, reducing computational time and
favouring diversity, preventing premature convergence. We compare our approach
with current MEL methods in several downstream tasks. The generated designs
score higher in all the tasks, are more diverse, and are quickly generated
compared to morpho-evolution with static parameters.

                                        <span>  A key challenge for the widespread application of learning-based models for
robotic perception is to significantly reduce the required amount of annotated
training data while achieving accurate predictions. This is essential not only
to decrease operating costs but also to speed up deployment time. In this work,
we address this challenge for PAnoptic SegmenTation with fEw Labels (PASTEL) by
exploiting the groundwork paved by visual foundation models. We leverage
descriptive image features from such a model to train two lightweight network
heads for semantic segmentation and object boundary detection, using very few
annotated training samples. We then merge their predictions via a novel fusion
module that yields panoptic maps based on normalized cut. To further enhance
the performance, we utilize self-training on unlabeled images selected by a
feature-driven similarity scheme. We underline the relevance of our approach by
employing PASTEL to important robot perception use cases from autonomous
driving and agricultural robotics. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate
that PASTEL significantly outperforms previous methods for label-efficient
segmentation even when using fewer annotations. The code of our work is

integrated robots with superior flexibility and potential machine intelligence.
However, current fluidically driven soft robots suffer from either a large
number of input controlling devices, or limited driving power. Here, we propose
a hydraulic fluidic logic circuitry for liquid driven soft robots, leveraging
3D printing technologies. The fundamental building blocks of the system are
hydraulic normally-on and normally-off logic gates, namely NOT and AND, along
with a multi-connected channel structure functioning as OR. Using minimal-input
design principles, the XOR gate can be simplified to only two valves, and used
to construct a sensor-free error detector. The design principle can also be
extended to full adders, as well as amplifiers, which can greatly improve the
flow efficiency of the system. Additionally, taking advantage of the
incompressible nature of liquid and optimized logic circuitry using the
minimal-input design principle, we present a quadruped soft robot integrated
with combinational fluidic logic, realizing bidirectional turtle-like
locomotion, controlled by only two inputs. The robot is capable of walking
under heavy load and performing controllable underwater locomotion. This
hydraulic fluidic soft robotic system utilizes a small number of inputs to
control multiple distinct outputs, and alters the internal state of the circuit
solely based on external inputs, holding significant promises for the
development of microfluidics, fluidic logic, and intricate internal systems of
untethered soft robots with machine intelligence.

pesticide treatments while maintaining crop quality and quantity. In this
paper, we introduce BonnBot-I a precise weed management platform which can also
performs field monitoring. Driven by crop monitoring approaches that can
accurately locate and classify plants (weed and crop) we further improve their
performance by fusing the platform available GNSS and wheel odometry. This
improves the tracking accuracy of our crop monitoring approach from a
normalized average error of 8.3% to 3.5%, evaluated on a new publicly available
corn dataset. We also present a novel arrangement of weeding tools mounted on
linear actuators evaluated in simulated environments. We replicate weed
distributions from a real field, using the results from our monitoring
approach, and show the validity of our work-space division techniques which
require significantly less movement (a 50% reduction) to achieve similar
results. Overall, BonnBot-I is a significant step forward in precise weed
management with a novel method of selectively spraying and controlling weeds in
an arable field.

obstacles, and strong flow disturbances, such as in high-flow rivers, poses
significant challenges for USVs. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel methodology that leverages two types of attention: spatial attention,
which learns to integrate diverse environmental factors and sensory information
into navigation decisions, and temporal attention within a transformer
framework to account for the dynamic, continuously changing nature of the
environment. We devise MarineFormer, a Trans{\bf former}-based navigation
policy for dynamic {\bf Marine} environments, trained end-to-end through
reinforcement learning (RL). At its core, MarineFormer uses graph attention to
capture spatial information and a transformer architecture to process temporal
sequences in an environment that simulates a 2D turbulent marine condition
involving multiple static and dynamic obstacles. We extensively evaluate the
performance of the proposed method versus the state-of-the-art methods, as well
as other classical planners. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by
nearly $20\%$ in episode completion success rate and additionally enhances the
USV's path length efficiency.

                                        <span>  Predicting and executing a sequence of actions without intermediate
replanning, known as action chunking, is increasingly used in robot learning
from human demonstrations. Yet, its reported effects on the learned policy are
inconsistent: some studies find it crucial for achieving strong results, while
others observe decreased performance. In this paper, we first dissect how
action chunking impacts the divergence between a learner and a demonstrator. We
find that action chunking allows the learner to better capture the temporal
dependencies in demonstrations but at the cost of reduced reactivity in
stochastic environments. To address this tradeoff, we propose Bidirectional
Decoding (BID), a test-time inference algorithm that bridges action chunking
with closed-loop operations. BID samples multiple predictions at each time step
and searches for the optimal one based on two criteria: (i) backward coherence,
which favors samples that align with previous decisions; (ii) forward contrast,
which seeks samples of high likelihood for future plans. By coupling decisions
within and across action chunks, BID promotes consistency over time while
maintaining reactivity to unexpected changes. Experimental results show that
BID boosts the performance of two state-of-the-art generative policies across
seven simulation benchmarks and two real-world tasks. Code and videos are

agent aims to alter a security monitoring system's sensor readings so as to
disguise its adversarial itinerary as an allowed itinerary in the environment.
The adversarial itinerary set and allowed itinerary set are captured by regular
languages. To deviate without being detected, we investigate whether there
exists a strategy for the agent to alter the sensor readings, with a minimal
cost, such that for any of those paths it takes, the system thinks the agent
took a path within the allowed itinerary. Our formulation assumes an offline
sensor alteration where the agent determines the sensor alteration strategy and
implement it, and then carry out any path in its deviation itinerary. We prove
that the problem of solving the optimal sensor alteration is NP-hard, by a
reduction from the directed multi-cut problem. Further, we present an exact
algorithm based on integer linear programming and demonstrate the correctness
and the efficacy of the algorithm in case studies.

specific tasks. This paper focuses on enhancing the recognition capability of
small-scale grasping, aiming to improve the overall accuracy of grasping
prediction results and the generalization ability of the network. We propose an
enhanced receptive field method that includes a multi-radii cylinder grouping
module and a passive attention module. This method enhances the receptive field
area within the graspable space and strengthens the learning of graspable
features. Additionally, we design a graspable balance sampling module based on
a segmentation network, which enables the network to focus on features of small
objects, thereby improving the recognition capability of small-scale grasping.
Our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GraspNet-1Billion
dataset, with an overall improvement of approximately 10% in average
precision@k (AP). Furthermore, we deployed our grasp detection model in
pybullet grasping platform, which validates the effectiveness of our method.

However, implementing such systems presents challenges in terms of intelligent

integrate with 24 multimodal strain sensors by leveraging both deep learning
model and large language models to realize smart tensegrity. Using conductive
flexible tendons assisted by long short-term memory model, the tensegrity
achieves the self-shape reconstruction without extern sensors. Through
integrating the flask server and gpt-3.5-turbo model, the tensegrity
autonomously enables to send data to iPhone for wireless monitoring and
provides data analysis, explanation, prediction, and suggestions to human for
decision making. Finally, human interaction system of the tensegrity helps
human obtain necessary information of tensegrity from the aspect of human
language. Overall, this intelligent tensegrity-based system with self-sensing
tendons showcases potential for future exploration, making it a versatile tool
for real-world applications.

                                        <span>  When learning stable linear dynamical systems from data, three important
properties are desirable: i) predictive accuracy, ii) provable stability, and
iii) computational efficiency. Unconstrained minimization of reconstruction
errors leads to high accuracy and efficiency but cannot guarantee stability.
Existing methods to remedy this focus on enforcing stability while also
ensuring accuracy, but do so only at the cost of increased computation. In this
work, we investigate if a straightforward approach can simultaneously offer all
three desiderata of learning stable linear systems. Specifically, we consider a
post-hoc approach that manipulates the spectrum of the learned system matrix
after it is learned in an unconstrained fashion. We call this approach spectrum
clipping (SC) as it involves eigen decomposition and subsequent reconstruction
of the system matrix after clipping all of its eigenvalues that are larger than
one to one (without altering the eigenvectors). Through detailed experiments
involving two different applications and publicly available benchmark datasets,
we demonstrate that this simple technique can simultaneously learn highly
accurate linear systems that are provably stable. Notably, we demonstrate that
SC can achieve similar or better performance than strong baselines while being
orders-of-magnitude faster. We also show that SC can be readily combined with
Koopman operators to learn stable nonlinear dynamics, such as those underlying
complex dexterous manipulation skills involving multi-fingered robotic hands.

                                        <span>  As robotic agents increasingly assist humans in reality, quadruped robots
offer unique opportunities for interaction in complex scenarios due to their
agile movement. However, building agents that can autonomously navigate, adapt,
and respond to versatile goals remains a significant challenge. In this work,
we introduce QuadrupedGPT designed to follow diverse commands with agility
comparable to that of a pet. The primary challenges addressed include: i)
effectively utilizing multimodal observations for informed decision-making; ii)
achieving agile control by integrating locomotion and navigation; iii)
developing advanced cognition to execute long-term objectives. Our QuadrupedGPT
interprets human commands and environmental contexts using a large multimodal
model. Leveraging its extensive knowledge base, the agent autonomously assigns
parameters for adaptive locomotion policies and devises safe yet efficient
paths toward its goals. Additionally, it employs high-level reasoning to
decompose long-term goals into a sequence of executable subgoals. Through
comprehensive experiments, our agent shows proficiency in handling diverse
tasks and intricate instructions, representing a significant step toward the
development of versatile quadruped agents for open-ended environments.

with several beneficial properties such as energy efficiency, collision
resistance, and ability to work in close proximity to human users. While
existing blimp designs have mainly used propeller-based propulsion, we focus
our attention to an alternate locomotion method, flapping wings. Specifically,
this paper introduces a flapping-wing blimp inspired by manta rays, in contrast
to existing research on flapping-wing vehicles that draw inspiration from
insects or birds. We present the overall design and control scheme of the blimp
as well as the analysis on how the wing performs. The effects of wing shape and
flapping characteristics on the thrust generation are studied experimentally.
We also demonstrate that the flapping-wing blimp has a significant range
advantage over propeller-based systems.

                                        <span>  Rendezvous aims at gathering all robots at a specific location, which is an
important collaborative behavior for multi-robot systems. However, in an
unknown environment, it is challenging to achieve rendezvous. Previous
researches mainly focus on special scenarios where communication is not allowed
and each robot executes a random searching strategy, which is highly
time-consuming, especially in large-scale environments. In this work, we focus
on rendezvous in unknown environments where communication is available. We
divide this task into two steps: rendezvous based environment exploration with
relative pose (RP) estimation and rendezvous point selection. A new strategy
called partitioned and incomplete exploration for rendezvous (PIER) is proposed
to efficiently explore the unknown environment, where lightweight topological
maps are constructed and shared among robots for RP estimation with very few
communications. Then, a rendezvous point selection algorithm based on the
merged topological map is proposed for efficient rendezvous for multi-robot
systems. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated in both
simulations and real-world experiments.

                                        <span>  This paper introduces an attacking mechanism to challenge the resilience of
autonomous driving systems. Specifically, we manipulate the decision-making
processes of an autonomous vehicle by dynamically displaying adversarial
patches on a screen mounted on another moving vehicle. These patches are
optimized to deceive the object detection models into misclassifying targeted
objects, e.g., traffic signs. Such manipulation has significant implications
for critical multi-vehicle interactions such as intersection crossing and lane
changing, which are vital for safe and efficient autonomous driving systems.
Particularly, we make four major contributions. First, we introduce a novel
adversarial attack approach where the patch is not co-located with its target,
enabling more versatile and stealthy attacks. Moreover, our method utilizes
dynamic patches displayed on a screen, allowing for adaptive changes and
movement, enhancing the flexibility and performance of the attack. To do so, we
design a Screen Image Transformation Network (SIT-Net), which simulates
environmental effects on the displayed images, narrowing the gap between
simulated and real-world scenarios. Further, we integrate a positional loss
term into the adversarial training process to increase the success rate of the
dynamic attack. Finally, we shift the focus from merely attacking perceptual
systems to influencing the decision-making algorithms of self-driving systems.
Our experiments demonstrate the first successful implementation of such dynamic
adversarial attacks in real-world autonomous driving scenarios, paving the way
for advancements in the field of robust and secure autonomous driving.

applications such as lab-on-a-chip systems, drug delivery, and biotechnology
and has been a challenge for researchers. Ferrofluid marble (FM) is a marble
with a ferrofluid core that can easily be manipulated by a magnetic field.
Although FMs have great potential for accurate positioning and manipulation,
these marbles have not been precisely controlled in magnetic digital
microfluidics, so far. In this study for the first time, a novel method of
magnetic actuation is proposed using a pair of Helmholtz coils and permanent
magnets. The governing equations for controlling the FM position are
investigated, and it is shown that there are three different strategies for
adjusting the applied magnetic force. Then, experiments are conducted to
demonstrate the capability of the proposed method. To this aim, different
magnetic setups are proposed for manipulating FMs. These setups are compared in
terms of energy consumption and tracking ability across various frequencies.
The study showcases several applications of precise FM position control,
including controllable reciprocal positioning, simultaneous position control of
two FMs, the transport of non-magnetic liquid marbles using the FMs, and sample
extraction method from the liquid core of the FM.

dynamical systems are on the uptake. Koopman theory provides the theoretical
foundation for the extremely popular kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition
(kEDMD). In this work we propose a novel kEDMD scheme to approximate nonlinear
control systems accompanied by an in-depth error analysis. The main features of
the method are flexible sampling, regularization-based robustness, and an
adroit decomposition into micro and macro grids. In addition, we prove
proportionality, i.e., explicit dependence on the distance to the (controlled)
equilibrium, of the derived uniform bounds on the full approximation error.
Leveraging this key property, we rigorously show that asymptotic stability of
the data-driven surrogate (control) system implies asymptotic stability of the
original (control) system and vice versa.

identifying discrete-time nonlinear systems by embedding them into an
infinite-dimensional linear vector space. However, providing stability
guarantees while learning the continuous-time dynamics, especially under

propose an algorithmic framework to simultaneously learn the vector field and

data sampled across the state space and along the trajectories at a relatively
low sampling frequency. The proposed framework builds upon recently developed
high-accuracy Koopman generator learning for capturing transient system
transitions and physics-informed neural networks for training Lyapunov
functions. We show that the learned Lyapunov functions can be formally verified
using a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver and provide less
conservative estimates of the region of attraction compared to existing
methods.

estimation problem of a rigid-body moving in three-dimensional (3D) space with
six degrees-of-freedom (6 DoF). The highly nonlinear navigation kinematics are
formulated to ensure global representation of the navigation problem. A
computationally efficient Quaternion-based Navigation Unscented Kalman Filter
(QNUKF) is proposed on $\mathbb{S}^{3}\times\mathbb{R}^{3}\times\mathbb{R}^{3}$
imitating the true nonlinear navigation kinematics and utilize onboard
Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) units to achieve successful GPS-denied
navigation. The proposed QNUKF is designed in discrete form to operate based on
the data fusion of photographs garnered by a vision unit (stereo or monocular
camera) and information collected by a low-cost inertial measurement unit
(IMU). The photographs are processed to extract feature points in 3D space,
while the 6-axis IMU supplies angular velocity and accelerometer measurements
expressed with respect to the body-frame. Robustness and effectiveness of the
proposed QNUKF have been confirmed through experiments on a real-world dataset
collected by a drone navigating in 3D and consisting of stereo images and
6-axis IMU measurements. Also, the proposed approach is validated against
standard state-of-the-art filtering techniques. IEEE Keywords: Localization,

conclusion, all tokens asymptotically converge to each other, a phenomenon that
has been empirically reported in the literature. Our findings are carefully

resolutions, e.g., at the level of individuals or countries, but it is not
always clear how properties at one resolution can carry over to another.
Accordingly, in this work we use dissipativity theory from control system
analysis to characterize composite spreading networks that are comprised by
many interacting subnetworks. We first develop a method to represent spreading
networks that have inputs and outputs. Then we define a composition operation
for composing multiple spreading networks into a larger composite spreading
network. Next, we develop storage and supply rate functions that can be used to
demonstrate that spreading dynamics are dissipative. We then derive conditions
under which a composite spreading network will converge to a disease-free
equilibrium as long as its constituent spreading networks are dissipative with
respect to those storage and supply rate functions. To illustrate these
results, we use simulations of an influenza outbreak in a primary school, and
we show that an outbreak can be prevented by decreasing the average interaction
time between any pair of classes to less than 79% of the original interaction
time.

power flow (PF) analysis that effectively captures the nonlinear dynamics of
large-scale modern power systems. The proposed neural network (NN) architecture
consists of two important advancements in the training pipeline: (A) a
double-head feed-forward NN that aligns with PF analysis, including an
activation function that adjusts to active and reactive power consumption
patterns, and (B) a physics-based loss function that partially incorporates
power system topology information. The effectiveness of the proposed
architecture is illustrated through 4-bus, 15-bus, 290-bus, and 2224-bus test
systems and is evaluated against two baselines: a linear regression model (LR)
and a black-box NN (MLP). The comparison is based on (i) generalization
ability, (ii) robustness, (iii) impact of training dataset size on
generalization ability, (iv) accuracy in approximating derived PF quantities
(specifically line current, line active power, and line reactive power), and
(v) scalability. Results demonstrate that PINN4PF outperforms both baselines
across all test systems by up to two orders of magnitude not only in terms of
direct criteria, e.g., generalization ability but also in terms of
approximating derived physical quantities.

for improving human-robot interaction and enabling complex operations in
dynamic environments. While large language models (LLMs) are not inherently
designed for planning, they can significantly enhance planning efficiency by
providing guidance and informing constraints to ensure safety. This paper
introduces a planning framework that integrates LLMs with 2D occupancy grid
maps and natural language commands to improve spatial reasoning and task
execution in resource-limited settings. By decomposing high-level commands and
real-time environmental data, the system generates structured navigation plans
for pick-and-place tasks, including obstacle avoidance, goal prioritization,
and adaptive behaviors. The framework dynamically recalculates paths to address
environmental changes and aligns with implicit social norms for seamless
human-robot interaction. Our results demonstrates the potential of LLMs to
design context-aware system to enhance navigation efficiency and safety in
industrial and dynamic environments.

                                        <span>  The increasing demand for scalable, efficient resource management in hybrid
cloud environments has led to the exploration of AI-driven approaches for
dynamic resource allocation. This paper presents an AI-driven framework for
resource allocation among microservices in hybrid cloud platforms. The
framework employs reinforcement learning (RL)-based resource utilization
optimization to reduce costs and improve performance. The framework integrates
AI models with cloud management tools to respond to challenges of dynamic
scaling and cost-efficient low-latency service delivery. The reinforcement
learning model continuously adjusts provisioned resources as required by the
microservices and predicts the future consumption trends to minimize both
under- and over-provisioning of resources. Preliminary simulation results
indicate that using AI in the provision of resources related to costs can
reduce expenditure by up to 30-40% compared to manual provisioning and
threshold-based auto-scaling approaches. It is also estimated that the
efficiency in resource utilization is expected to improve by 20%-30% with a
corresponding latency cut of 15%-20% during the peak demand periods. This study
compares the AI-driven approach with existing static and rule-based resource
allocation methods, demonstrating the capability of this new model to
outperform them in terms of flexibility and real-time interests. The results
indicate that reinforcement learning can make optimization of hybrid cloud
platforms even better, offering a 25-35% improvement in cost efficiency and the
power of scaling for microservice-based applications. The proposed framework is
a strong and scalable solution to managing cloud resources in dynamic and
performance-critical environments.

                                        <span>  Autonomous agents operating in adversarial scenarios face a fundamental
challenge: while they may know their adversaries' high-level objectives, such
as reaching specific destinations within time constraints, the exact policies
these adversaries will employ remain unknown. Traditional approaches address
this challenge by treating the adversary's state as a partially observable
element, leading to a formulation as a Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP). However, the induced belief-space dynamics in a POMDP require
knowledge of the system's transition dynamics, which, in this case, depend on
the adversary's unknown policy. Our key observation is that while an
adversary's exact policy is unknown, their behavior is necessarily constrained
by their mission objectives and the physical environment, allowing us to
characterize the space of possible behaviors without assuming specific
policies. In this paper, we develop Task-Aware Behavior Fields (TAB-Fields), a
representation that captures adversary state distributions over time by
computing the most unbiased probability distribution consistent with known
constraints. We construct TAB-Fields by solving a constrained optimization
problem that minimizes additional assumptions about adversary behavior beyond
mission and environmental requirements. We integrate TAB-Fields with standard
planning algorithms by introducing TAB-conditioned POMCP, an adaptation of
Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning. Through experiments in simulation
with underwater robots and hardware implementations with ground robots, we
demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to
baselines that either assume specific adversary policies or neglect mission
constraints altogether. Evaluation videos and code are available at

of a heterogeneous networked dynamic system (NDS), with each of its subsystems
being described by a continuous-time descriptor quadratic-bilinear
time-invariant (QBTI) model. No restrictions are put on the sampling rate.
Explicit formulas are derived respectively for the transient and steady-state
responses of the NDS, provided that the probing signal is generated by a linear
time invariant (LTI) system. Some relations have been derived between the NDS
steady-state response and its frequency domain input-output mappings. These
relations reveal that the value of some NDS associated TFMs can in principle be
estimated at almost any interested point of the imaginary axis from
input-output experimental data, as well as its derivatives and a right
tangential interpolation along an arbitrary direction. Based on these
relations, an estimation algorithm is suggested respectively for the parameters
of the NDS and the values of these TFMs.

opportunity for improving driving efficiency and alleviating traffic
congestion. However, existing research fails to address realistic multi-lane
highway scenarios without assuming connectivity, perception, and control
capabilities that are typically unavailable in current vehicles. This paper
proposes a novel AI system that is the first to improve highway traffic
efficiency compared with human-like traffic in realistic, simulated multi-lane
scenarios, while relying on existing connectivity, perception, and control
capabilities. At the core of our approach is a reinforcement learning based
controller that dynamically communicates time-headways to automated vehicles
near bottlenecks based on real-time traffic conditions. These desired
time-headways are then used by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems to adjust
their following distance. By (i) integrating existing traffic estimation
technology and low-bandwidth vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity, (ii)
leveraging safety-certified ACC systems, and (iii) targeting localized
bottleneck challenges that can be addressed independently in different
locations, we propose a practical, safe, and scalable system that can
positively impact numerous road users.

                                        <span>  HISs have recently shown the ability to support leaky waves, and to excite
plasmonic and HIS resonance frequency modes for use as an antenna. In this
paper, we analyzed, designed, and fabricated a TMA by directly feeding
edge-located HIS cells through a microstrip feeding network. In contrast to
other metasurface antennas that necessitate an external antenna to excite
metasurfaces, our approach is inspired by the TMA design methodology that
directly feeds the HIS cells rather than using it as a reflector. We developed
a circuit model for the proposed structure and compared the results with those
obtained from full-wave simulations. In addition, our further objective was to
simplify the structure based on the working principle of the proposed antenna.
This objective was achieved by converting square patches into parallel strip
lines, leading to an aperture efficiency of 0.77. This simplification also
creates additional space to explore various resonant patterns on the top
surface and the feeding network on the bottom surface of the TMA. Full-wave
simulation results indicate that, despite the compact dimensions of the
proposed array with 64 electrically small patch resonators
(1.84{\lambda}*1.84{\lambda}*0.032{\lambda}, where{\lambda}is the free space
wavelength at 6.0 GHz), it achieves a realized gain, HPBW of about 15.1 dBi and
28{\deg} respectively at 6 GHz. Finally, we constructed a prototype and
conducted measurements to validate the design. Measured results demonstrate
good agreement with simulation ones with a gain of about 13.5 (+-0.5) dBi and a
HPBW of 27{\deg} at 6 GHz. The proposed TMA is scaled to fit within the
required dimensions for smart handheld devices at higher frequencies, while
maintaining high gain capability. The design s scalability, single-feed, and
compact footprint make it optimal for diverse wireless communication systems,
such as car to car communications.

applications in healthcare, medicine, and scientific research. Magnetoelectric
(ME) wireless power transfer (WPT) has emerged as a promising approach for
powering miniature bio-implants because of its remarkable efficiency, safety
limit, and misalignment tolerance. However, achieving low-power and
high-quality uplink communication using ME remains a challenge. This paper
presents a pulse-width modulated (PWM) ME backscatter uplink communication
enabled by a switched-capacitor energy extraction (SCEE) technique. The SCEE
rapidly extracts and dissipates the kinetic energy within the ME transducer
during its ringdown period, enabling time-domain PWM in ME backscatter. Various
circuit techniques are presented to realize SCEE with low power consumption.
This paper also describes the high-order modeling of ME transducers to
facilitate the design and analysis, which shows good matching with measurement.
Our prototyping system includes a millimeter-scale ME implant with a fully
integrated system-on-chip (SoC) and a portable transceiver for power transfer
and bidirectional communication. SCEE is proven to induce >50% amplitude
reduction within 2 ME cycles, leading to a PWM ME backscatter uplink with 17.73
kbps data rate and 0.9 pJ/bit efficiency. It also achieves 8.5 x 10 -5
bit-error-rate (BER) at a 5 cm distance, using a lightweight
multi-layer-perception (MLP) decoding algorithm. Finally, the system
demonstrates continuous wireless neural local-field potential (LFP) recording
in an in vitro setup.

                                        <span>  Closed-loop performance of sequential decision making algorithms, such as
model predictive control, depends strongly on the parameters of cost functions,
models, and constraints. Bayesian optimization is a common approach to learning
these parameters based on closed-loop experiments. However, traditional
Bayesian optimization approaches treat the learning problem as a black box,
ignoring valuable information and knowledge about the structure of the
underlying problem, resulting in slow convergence and high experimental
resource use. We propose a time-series-informed optimization framework that
incorporates intermediate performance evaluations from early iterations of each
experimental episode into the learning procedure. Additionally, probabilistic
early stopping criteria are proposed to terminate unpromising experiments,
significantly reducing experimental time. Simulation results show that our
approach achieves baseline performance with approximately half the resources.
Moreover, with the same resource budget, our approach outperforms the baseline
in terms of final closed-loop performance, highlighting its efficiency in
sequential decision making scenarios.

                                        <span>  Most birds can navigate seamlessly between aerial and terrestrial
environments. Whereas the forelimbs evolved into wings primarily for flight,
the hindlimbs serve diverse functions such as walking, hopping, and leaping,
and jumping take-off for transitions into flight. These capabilities have
inspired engineers to aim for similar multi-modality in aerial robots,
expanding their range of applications across diverse environments. However,
challenges remain in reproducing multi-modal locomotion, across gaits with
distinct kinematics and propulsive characteristics, such as walking and
jumping, while preserving lightweight mass for flight. This tradeoff between
mechanical complexity and versatility limits most existing aerial robots to
only one additional locomotor mode. Here, we overcome the
complexity-versatility tradeoff with RAVEN (Robotic Avian-inspired Vehicle for
multiple ENvironments), which uses its bird-inspired multi-functional legs to
jump rapidly into flight, walk on ground and hop over obstacles and gaps
similar to the multi-modal locomotion of birds. We show that jumping for
take-off contributes substantially to initial flight take-off speed and,
remarkably, that it is more energy-efficient than solely propeller-based
take-off. Our analysis suggests an important tradeoff in mass distribution
between legs and body among birds adapted for different locomotor strategies,
with greater investment in leg mass among terrestrial birds with multi-modal
gait demands. Multi-functional robot legs expand opportunities to deploy
traditional fixed-wing aircraft in complex terrains through autonomous
take-offs and multi-modal gaits.

                                        <span>  Accurate grasp force control is one of the key skills for ensuring successful
and damage-free robotic grasping of objects. Although existing methods have
conducted in-depth research on slip detection and grasping force planning, they
often overlook the issue of adaptive tracking of the actual force to the target
force when handling objects with different material properties. The optimal
parameters of a force tracking controller are significantly influenced by the
object's stiffness, and many adaptive force tracking algorithms rely on
stiffness estimation. However, real-world objects often exhibit viscous,
plastic, or other more complex nonlinear time-varying behaviors, and existing
studies provide insufficient support for these materials in terms of stiffness
definition and estimation. To address this, this paper introduces the concept
of generalized stiffness, extending the definition of stiffness to nonlinear
time-varying grasp system models, and proposes an online generalized stiffness
estimator based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Based on generalized
stiffness, this paper proposes an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy using
a PI controller as an example, enabling dynamic force tracking for objects with
varying characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves high precision and short probing time, while showing better
adaptability to non-ideal objects compared to existing methods. The method
effectively solves the problem of grasp force tracking in unknown, nonlinear,
and time-varying grasp systems, enhancing the robotic grasping ability in
unstructured environments.

resistance values of an unknown circular planar passive resistive network using
limitedly available resistance distance measurements is considered. We develop
a multistage topology reconstruction method, assuming that the number of
boundary and interior nodes, the maximum and minimum edge conductance, and the
Kirchhoff index are known apriori. First, a maximal circular planar electrical
network consisting of edges with resistors and switches is constructed; no
interior nodes are considered. A sparse difference in convex program
$\mathbf{\Pi}_1$ accompanied by round down algorithm is posed to determine the
switch positions. The solution gives us a topology that is then utilized to
develop a heuristic method to place the interior nodes. The heuristic method
consists of reformulating $\mathbf{\Pi}_1$ as a difference of convex program
$\mathbf{\Pi}_2$ with relaxed edge weight constraints and the quadratic cost.
The interior node placement thus obtained may lead to a non-planar topology. We
then use the modified Auslander, Parter, and Goldstein algorithm to obtain a
set of planar network topologies and re-optimize the edge weights by solving
$\mathbf{\Pi}_3$ for each topology. Optimization problems posed are difference
of convex programming problem, as a consequence of constraints triangle
inequality and the Kalmansons inequality. A numerical example is used to
demonstrate the proposed method.

Nordic ancillary service markets, the Danish transmission system operator,
Energinet, has introduced grid codes requiring a minimum 90% reliability for
the full availability of reserve capacity bids. This paper addresses the
bidding strategy of flexibility aggregators under Energinet's reliability
requirement by proposing a chance-constrained optimization model. An analytical
solution is developed using ideas from extreme value theory, focusing on the
"tail" of the empirical data used for flexibility estimation, capturing extreme
events where failures are more likely to occur. The proposed model is applied
to an electric vehicle aggregator participating in the Nordic market for
frequency containment reserve for disturbances (FCR-D). Our results from a
realistic case study show that the proposed analytical solution outperforms a
commonly used sample-based approach in terms of out-of-sample constraint
violation rate.

originate from the domain of machine learning. Herein, reinforcement learning
(RL) takes an elevated role, as it is inherently designed for sequential
decision making, and can be applied to optimal control problems without the
need for a plant system model. To advance education of control engineers and
operators in this field, this contribution targets an RL framework that can be
applied to educational hardware provided by the Lucas-N\"ulle company.
Specifically, the goal of inverted pendulum control is pursued by means of RL,
including both, swing-up and stabilization within a single holistic design
approach. Herein, the actual learning is enabled by separating corresponding
computations from the real-time control computer and outsourcing them to a
different hardware. This distributed architecture, however, necessitates
communication of the involved components, which is realized via CAN bus. The
experimental proof of concept is presented with an applied safeguarding
algorithm that prevents the plant from being operated harmfully during the
trial-and-error training phase.

control actions can only be realized in finitely many directions where it is
possible to actuate uniformly or logarithmically extended positive scaling
factors in each direction. Furthermore, a nearest-action selection approach is
used to map the continuous measurements to a realizable action where we show
that the approach satisfies a weak sector condition for multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Using the notion of input-to-state stability,
under some assumptions imposed on the transfer function of the system, we show
that the closed-loop system converges to the target ball exponentially fast.
Moreover, when logarithmic extension for the scaling factors is realizable, the
closed-loop system is able to achieve asymptotic stability instead of only
practical stability. Finally, we present an example of the application that
confirms our analysis.

microtasks in medicine, manufacturing and the environment. However, surface
area has limited the natural powering, communication, functional integration,
and self-assembly of smart mass-fabricated modular robotic devices at small
scales. We demonstrate the integrated self-folding and self-rolling of
functionalized patterned interior and exterior membrane surfaces resulting in
programmable, self-assembling, inter-communicating and self-locomoting
micromodules (smartlets ess-than 1 mm3) with interior chambers for on-board
buoyancy control. The microbotic divers, with 360 deg solar harvesting rolls,
function with sufficient ambient power for communication and programmed
locomotion in water via electrolysis. The folding faces carry rigid
microcomponents including silicon chiplets as microprocessors and micro-LEDs
for communication. This remodels modular microrobotics closer to the
surface-rich modular autonomy of biological cells and provides an economical
platform for microscopic applications.

interconnects approached due to research and design in high speed digital
processors. Use of dielectrics, instead, suitable for light propagation was
more attractive due to its extremely wide bandwidth. Many of the devices, both
active and passive, have been demonstrated using these insulating materials.
Due to its excellent optical characteristics, established fabrication history,
and cheaper throughput, silicon found its place in photonics arena. However,
due to its indirect band structure, efficient light sources are not possible
using silicon as the base material. Nevertheless, techniques such as stimulated
Raman scattering and third-harmonic generation have made it possible to avoid
this natural hurdle in the path of silicon as a light source. This paper
reviews basic theory of stimulated Raman scattering, its applications in the
context of silicon based photonic integrated circuits and describes ways to
improve this nonlinear effect. This paper also covers few of the most important
demonstrations of stimulated Raman scattering published in literature from the
last decade.

                                        <span>  As large language models (LLMs) grow in popularity for their diverse
capabilities, improving the efficiency of their inference systems has become
increasingly critical. Batching LLM requests is a critical step in scheduling
the inference jobs on servers (e.g. GPUs), enabling the system to maximize
throughput by allowing multiple requests to be processed in parallel. However,
requests often have varying generation lengths, causing resource
underutilization, as hardware must wait for the longest-running request in the
batch to complete before moving to the next batch. We formalize this problem
from a queueing-theoretic perspective, and aim to design a control policy which
is throughput-optimal. We propose Multi-Bin Batching, a simple yet effective
method that can provably improve LLM inference throughput by grouping requests
with similar (predicted) execution times into predetermined bins. Through a
combination of theoretical analysis and experiments, including real-world LLM
inference scenarios, we demonstrate significant throughput gains compared to
standard batching approaches.

autonomous trajectory planning algorithm for the asteroid reconnaissance phase
of a deep-space exploration mission. The reconnaissance phase is a low-altitude
flyby to collect detailed information around a potential landing site. Although
such autonomous deep-space exploration missions have garnered considerable
interest recently, state-of-the-practice in trajectory design involves a
time-intensive ground-based open-loop process that forward propagates multiple
trajectories with a range of initial conditions and parameters to account for
uncertainties in spacecraft knowledge and actuation. In this work, we introduce
a stochastic trajectory optimization-based approach to generate trajectories
that satisfy both the mission and spacecraft safety constraints during the
reconnaissance phase of the Deep-space Autonomous Robotic Explorer (DARE)
mission concept, which seeks to travel to and explore a near-Earth object
autonomously, with minimal ground intervention. We first use the
Multi-Spacecraft Concept and Autonomy Tool (MuSCAT) simulation framework to
rigorously validate the underlying modeling assumptions for our trajectory
planner and then propose a method to transform this stochastic optimal control
problem into a deterministic one tailored for use with an off-the-shelf
nonlinear solver. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed
algorithmic approach through extensive numerical experiments and show that it
outperforms the state-of-the-practice benchmark used for representative
missions.

depletion of energy resources, particularly in the context of smart buildings.
As the demand for energy increases alongside the necessity for efficient
building maintenance, it becomes imperative to explore innovative energy
management solutions. We present a comprehensive review of Internet of Things
(IoT)-based frameworks aimed at smart city energy management, highlighting the
pivotal role of IoT devices in addressing these issues due to their
compactness, sensing, measurement, and computing capabilities. Our review
methodology encompasses a thorough analysis of existing literature on IoT
architectures and frameworks for intelligent energy management applications. We
focus on systems that not only collect and store data but also support
intelligent analysis for monitoring, controlling, and enhancing system
efficiency. Additionally, we examine the potential for these frameworks to
serve as platforms for the development of third-party applications, thereby
extending their utility and adaptability. The findings from our review indicate
that IoT-based frameworks offer significant potential to reduce energy
consumption and environmental impact in smart buildings. Through the adoption
of intelligent mechanisms and solutions, these frameworks facilitate effective
energy management, leading to improved system efficiency and sustainability.
Considering these findings, we recommend further exploration and adoption of
IoT-based wireless sensing systems in smart buildings as a strategic approach
to energy management. Our review underscores the importance of incorporating
intelligent analysis and enabling the development of third-party applications
within the IoT framework to efficiently meet the evolving energy demands and
maintenance challenges

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose a very efficient numerical method based on the
L-BFGS-B algorithm for identifying linear and nonlinear discrete-time
state-space models, possibly under $\ell_1$ and group-Lasso regularization for
reducing model complexity. For the identification of linear models, we show
that, compared to classical linear subspace methods, the approach often
provides better results, is much more general in terms of the loss and
regularization terms used (such as penalties for enforcing system stability),
and is also more stable from a numerical point of view. The proposed method not
only enriches the existing set of linear system identification tools but can
also be applied to identifying a very broad class of parametric nonlinear
state-space models, including recurrent neural networks. We illustrate the
approach on synthetic and experimental datasets and apply it to solve a
challenging industrial robot benchmark for nonlinear multi-input/multi-output
system identification. A Python implementation of the proposed identification
method is available in the package jax-sysid, available at
https://github.com/bemporad/jax-sysid.

                                        <span>  We investigate discrete-time conewise linear systems (CLS) for which all the
solutions exhibit a finite number of switches. By switches, we mean transitions
of a solution from one cone to another. Our interest in this class of CLS comes
from the optimization-based control of an insulin infusion model for which the
fact that solutions switch finitely many times appears to be key to establish
the global exponential stability of the origin. The stability analysis of this
class of CLS greatly simplifies compared to general CLS as all solutions
eventually exhibit linear dynamics. The main challenge is to characterize CLS
satisfying this finite number of switches property. We first present general
conditions in terms of set intersections for this purpose. To ease the testing
of these conditions, we translate them as a non-negativity test of linear forms
using Farkas lemma. As a result, the problem reduces to verify the
non-negativity of a single solution to an auxiliary linear discrete-time
system. Interestingly, this property differs from the classical non-negativity
problem, where any solution to a system must remain non-negative
(component-wise) for any non-negative initial condition, and thus requires
novel tools to test it. We finally illustrate the relevance of the presented
results on the optimal insulin infusion problem.

and connected automated vehicles (CAVs) in mixed-traffic intersections. We aim
to develop an optimization-based control framework that leverages both the
coordination capabilities of CAVs at higher penetration rates and intelligent
traffic management using traffic lights at lower penetration rates. Since the
resulting optimization problem is a multi-agent mixed-integer quadratic
program, we propose a penalization-enhanced maximum block improvement algorithm
to solve the problem in a distributed manner. The proposed algorithm, under
certain mild conditions, yields a feasible person-by-person optimal solution of
the centralized problem. The performance of the control framework and the
distributed algorithm is validated through simulations across various
penetration rates and traffic volumes.

security, traditionally analyzed using number theory methods. In this paper, we
introduce a novel perspective on cryptosystems by viewing the Diffie-Hellman
key exchange and the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cryptosystem as nonlinear dynamical
systems. By applying Koopman theory, we transform these dynamical systems into
higher-dimensional spaces and analytically derive equivalent purely linear
systems. This formulation allows us to reconstruct the secret integers of the
cryptosystems through straightforward manipulations, leveraging the tools
available for linear systems analysis. Additionally, we establish an upper
bound on the minimum lifting dimension required to achieve perfect accuracy.
Our results on the required lifting dimension are in line with the
intractability of brute-force attacks. To showcase the potential of our
approach, we establish connections between our findings and existing results on
algorithmic complexity. Furthermore, we extend this methodology to a
data-driven context, where the Koopman representation is learned from data
samples of the cryptosystems.

local MPC controllers to control different subsystems, exchanging information
with each other through an iterative procedure to enhance overall control
performance compared to the decentralized architecture. However, this method
can result in high communication between the controllers and computational
costs. In this work, the amount of information exchanged and the computational
costs of DiMPC are reduced significantly by developing novel iteration-free
solution algorithms based on multiparametric (mp) programming. These algorithms
replace the iterative procedure with simultaneous solutions of explicit mpDiMPC
control law functions. The reduced communication among local controllers
decreases system latency, which is crucial for real-time control applications.
The effectiveness of the proposed iteration-free mpDiMPC algorithms is
demonstrated through comprehensive numerical simulations involving groups of
coupled linear subsystems, which are interconnected through their inputs and a
cooperative plant-wide cost function.

promises to revolutionize computing by efficiently solving previously
intractable problems. Recent years have seen tremendous progress on both the
experimental realization of quantum computing devices as well as the
development and implementation of quantum algorithms. Yet, realizing
computational advantages of quantum computers in practice remains a widely open
problem due to numerous fundamental challenges. Interestingly, many of these
challenges are connected to performance, robustness, scalability, optimization,
or feedback, all of which are central concepts in control theory. This paper
provides a tutorial introduction to quantum computing from the perspective of
control theory. We introduce the mathematical framework of quantum algorithms
ranging from basic elements including quantum bits and quantum gates to more
advanced concepts such as variational quantum algorithms and quantum errors.
The tutorial only requires basic knowledge of linear algebra and, in
particular, no prior exposure to quantum physics. Our main goal is to equip
readers with the mathematical basics required to understand and possibly solve
(control-related) problems in quantum computing. In particular, beyond the
tutorial introduction, we provide a list of research challenges in the field of
quantum computing and discuss their connections to control.

unknown multiplicative noise terms, are a major obstacle for reliable quantum
computing. In this paper, we present a framework for analyzing the robustness
of quantum algorithms against coherent control errors using Lipschitz bounds.
We derive worst-case fidelity bounds which show that the resilience against
coherent control errors is mainly influenced by the norms of the Hamiltonians
generating the individual gates. These bounds are explicitly computable even
for large circuits, and they can be used to guarantee fault-tolerance via
threshold theorems. Moreover, we apply our theoretical framework to derive a
novel guideline for robust quantum algorithm design and transpilation, which
amounts to reducing the norms of the Hamiltonians. Using the $3$-qubit Quantum
Fourier Transform as an example application, we demonstrate that this guideline
targets robustness more effectively than existing ones based on circuit depth
or gate count. Furthermore, we apply our framework to study the effect of
parameter regularization in variational quantum algorithms. The practicality of
the theoretical results is demonstrated via implementations in simulation and
on a quantum computer.

authenticating the identities of numerous nodes is imperative. Traditional
cryptography-based authentication methods suffer from issues such as low
compatibility, reliability, and high complexity. Physical-Layer Authentication
(PLA) is emerging as a promising complement due to its exploitation of unique
properties in wireless environments. Recently, Machine Learning (ML)-based PLA
has gained attention for its intelligence, adaptability, universality, and
scalability compared to non-ML approaches. However, a comprehensive overview of
state-of-the-art ML-based PLA and its foundational aspects is lacking. This
paper presents a comprehensive survey of characteristics and technologies that
can be used in the ML-based PLA. We categorize existing ML-based PLA schemes
into two main types: multi-device identification and attack detection schemes.
In deep learning-based multi-device identification schemes, Deep Neural
Networks are employed to train models, avoiding complex processing and expert
feature transformation. Deep learning-based multi-device identification schemes
are further subdivided, with schemes based on Convolutional Neural Networks
being extensively researched. In ML-based attack detection schemes, receivers
utilize intelligent ML techniques to set detection thresholds automatically,
eliminating the need for manual calculation or knowledge of channel models.
ML-based attack detection schemes are categorized into three sub-types:
Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.
Additionally, we summarize open-source datasets used for PLA, encompassing
Radio Frequency fingerprints and channel fingerprints. Finally, this paper
outlines future research directions to guide researchers in related fields.

                                        <span>  Cultivation and weeding are two of the primary tasks performed by farmers
today. A recent challenge for weeding is the desire to reduce herbicide and
pesticide treatments while maintaining crop quality and quantity. In this
paper, we introduce BonnBot-I a precise weed management platform which can also
performs field monitoring. Driven by crop monitoring approaches that can
accurately locate and classify plants (weed and crop) we further improve their
performance by fusing the platform available GNSS and wheel odometry. This
improves the tracking accuracy of our crop monitoring approach from a
normalized average error of 8.3% to 3.5%, evaluated on a new publicly available
corn dataset. We also present a novel arrangement of weeding tools mounted on
linear actuators evaluated in simulated environments. We replicate weed
distributions from a real field, using the results from our monitoring
approach, and show the validity of our work-space division techniques which
require significantly less movement (a 50% reduction) to achieve similar
results. Overall, BonnBot-I is a significant step forward in precise weed
management with a novel method of selectively spraying and controlling weeds in
an arable field.

efficiency of solution algorithms for high-dimensional discrete
simulation-based optimization problems. The technique is based on innovative
adaptive partitioning strategies that partition the feasible region using
solutions that has already been simulated as well as prior knowledge of the
problem of interesting. We integrate the proposed strategies with the Empirical
Stochastic Branch-and-Bound framework proposed by Xu and Nelson (2013). This
combination leads to a general-purpose discrete simulation-based optimization
algorithm that is both globally convergent and has good small sample
(finite-time) performance. The proposed general-purpose discrete
simulation-based optimization algorithm is validated on a synthetic discrete
simulation-based optimization problem and is then used to address a real-world
car-sharing fleet assignment problem. Experiment results show that the proposed
strategy can increase the algorithm efficiency significantly.

                                        <span>  When learning stable linear dynamical systems from data, three important
properties are desirable: i) predictive accuracy, ii) provable stability, and
iii) computational efficiency. Unconstrained minimization of reconstruction
errors leads to high accuracy and efficiency but cannot guarantee stability.
Existing methods to remedy this focus on enforcing stability while also
ensuring accuracy, but do so only at the cost of increased computation. In this
work, we investigate if a straightforward approach can simultaneously offer all
three desiderata of learning stable linear systems. Specifically, we consider a
post-hoc approach that manipulates the spectrum of the learned system matrix
after it is learned in an unconstrained fashion. We call this approach spectrum
clipping (SC) as it involves eigen decomposition and subsequent reconstruction
of the system matrix after clipping all of its eigenvalues that are larger than
one to one (without altering the eigenvectors). Through detailed experiments
involving two different applications and publicly available benchmark datasets,
we demonstrate that this simple technique can simultaneously learn highly
accurate linear systems that are provably stable. Notably, we demonstrate that
SC can achieve similar or better performance than strong baselines while being
orders-of-magnitude faster. We also show that SC can be readily combined with
Koopman operators to learn stable nonlinear dynamics, such as those underlying
complex dexterous manipulation skills involving multi-fingered robotic hands.

methodology based on modules comprised of clusters of interacting measurements.
The methodology relies on the process flow diagram (PFD) and control system
structure without requiring cross-correlation data to create monitoring
modules. The methodology is validated on the Tennessee Eastman Process
benchmark using full Principal Component Analysis (f-PCA) in the monitoring
modules. The results are comparable to nonlinear techniques implemented in a
centralized manner such as Kernel PCA (KPCA), Autoencoders (AE), and Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNN), or distributed techniques like the Distributed Canonical
Correlation Analysis (DCCA). Temporal plots of fault detection by different
modules show clearly the magnitude and propagation of the fault through each
module, pinpointing the module where the fault originates, and separating
controllable faults from other faults. This information, combined with PCA
contribution plots, helps detection and identification as effectively as more
complex nonlinear centralized or distributed methods.

manages the conversion of genetic variation into genetic gain to facilitate
short-term competitiveness and long-term sustainability in breeding programmes.
Traditional approaches to OCS do not account for uncertainty in input data,
which is always present and challenges optimization and practical decision
making. Here we use concepts from robust optimization to derive a robust OCS
problem and develop two ways to solve the problem using either conic
optimization or sequential quadratic programming. We have developed the
open-source Python package 'robustocs' that leverages the Gurobi and HiGHS
solvers to carry out these methods. Our testing shows favourable performance
when solving the robust OCS problem using sequential quadratic programming and
the HiGHS solver.

dynamical systems are on the uptake. Koopman theory provides the theoretical
foundation for the extremely popular kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition
(kEDMD). In this work we propose a novel kEDMD scheme to approximate nonlinear
control systems accompanied by an in-depth error analysis. The main features of
the method are flexible sampling, regularization-based robustness, and an
adroit decomposition into micro and macro grids. In addition, we prove
proportionality, i.e., explicit dependence on the distance to the (controlled)
equilibrium, of the derived uniform bounds on the full approximation error.
Leveraging this key property, we rigorously show that asymptotic stability of
the data-driven surrogate (control) system implies asymptotic stability of the
original (control) system and vice versa.

                                        <span>  Non-convex Machine Learning problems typically do not adhere to the standard
smoothness assumption. Based on empirical findings, Zhang et al. (2020b)
proposed a more realistic generalized $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness assumption,
though it remains largely unexplored. Many existing algorithms designed for
standard smooth problems need to be revised. However, in the context of
Federated Learning, only a few works address this problem but rely on
additional limiting assumptions. In this paper, we address this gap in the
literature: we propose and analyze new methods with local steps, partial
participation of clients, and Random Reshuffling without extra restrictive
assumptions beyond generalized smoothness. The proposed methods are based on
the proper interplay between clients' and server's stepsizes and gradient
clipping. Furthermore, we perform the first analysis of these methods under the
Polyak-{\L} ojasiewicz condition. Our theory is consistent with the known
results for standard smooth problems, and our experimental results support the
theoretical insights.

each token influences the propagation of every other token through a
transformer. In this paper we provide a rigorous, mathematical analysis of the
asymptotic properties of attention in transformers. Although we present several
results based on different assumptions, all of them point to the same
conclusion, all tokens asymptotically converge to each other, a phenomenon that
has been empirically reported in the literature. Our findings are carefully
compared with existing theoretical results and illustrated by simulations and
experimental studies using the GPT-2 model.

                                        <span>  Space missions, particularly complex, large-scale exploration campaigns, can
often involve many discrete decisions or events in their concepts of
operations. Whilst a variety of methods exist for the optimisation of
continuous variables in mission design, the inherent presence of discrete
events in mission ConOps disrupts the possibility of using methods that are
dependent on having well-defined, continuous mathematical expressions to define
the systems. Typically, mission architects will circumvent this problem by
solving the system optimisation for every permutation of the categorical
decisions if practical, or use metaheuristic solvers if not. However, this can
be prohibitively expensive in terms of computation time. Alternatively,
categorical decisions in optimisation problems can be expressed using binary
variables. If implemented naively, commercially available MILP solvers are
still slow to solve such a problem. Problems of this class can be solved more
efficiently using column generation methods. Here, restricted problems are
created by removing significant numbers of variables. The restricted problem is
solved, and the unused variables are priced to test which, if any, could
improve the objective of the restricted problem if they were to be added.
Column generation methods are problem-specific, and so there is no guaranteed
solution to these categorical problems. As such, the following paper proposes
guidelines for defining restricted problems representing space exploration
mission concepts of operations. The column generation process is described and
then applied to two case studies: a ConOps for a crewed Mars mission, in which
the design, assembly, and staging of the trans-Martian spacecraft is modelled
using discrete decisions; and the payload delivery scheduling of translunar
logistics in the context of an extended Artemis surface exploration campaign.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we research more in depth properties of Backtracking New
Q-Newton's method (recently designed by the third author), when used to find
roots of meromorphic functions.
  If $f=P/Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials in 1 complex variable z with
$deg (P)>deg (Q)$, we show the existence of an exceptional set
$\mathcal{E}\subset\mathbf{C}$, which is contained in a countable union of real
analytic curves in $\mathbf{R}^2=\mathbf{C}$, so that the following statements
A and B hold. Here, $\{z_n\}$ is the sequence constructed by BNQN with an
initial point $z_0$, not a pole of $f$.
  A) If $z_0\in\mathbb{C}\backslash\mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to a
root of $f$.
  B) If $z_0\in \mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to a critical point -
but not a root - of $f$.
  Experiments seem to indicate that in general, even when $f$ is a polynomial,
the set $\mathcal{E}$ is not contained in a finite union of real analytic
curves. We provide further results relevant to whether locally $\mathcal{E}$ is
contained in a finite number of real analytic curves. A similar result holds
for general meromorphic functions. Moreover, unlike previous work, here we do
not require that the parameters of BNQN are random, or that the meromorphic
function $f$ is generic.
  Based on the theoretical results, we explain (both rigorously and
heuristically) of what observed in experiments with BNQN, in previous works by
the authors. The dynamics of BNQN seems also to have some similarities (and
differences) to the classical Leau-Fatou's flowers.

steps that each require solving a system of matching conditions iteratively.
The state-of-the-art parallel preconditioner for linear problems leads to a set
of independent smaller systems that are currently hard to solve. We generalize
the preconditioner to the nonlinear case and propose a new, fast inversion
method for these smaller systems, avoiding disadvantages of the current options
with adjusted boundary conditions in the subproblems.

differential games with an output feedback information structure. We assume
linear time-invariant nominal dynamics influenced by deterministic external
disturbances, and players' risk preferences are expressed by a soft-constrained
quadratic cost criterion over an infinite horizon. We demonstrate that the
conditions available in the literature for the existence of a soft-constrained
output feedback Nash equilibrium (SCONE) are too stringent to satisfy, even in
low-dimensional games. To address this issue, using ideas from suboptimal
control, we introduce the concept of a soft-constrained output feedback
guaranteed cost equilibrium (SCOGCE). At an SCOGCE, the players' worst-case
costs are upper-bounded by a specified cost profile while maintaining an
equilibrium property. We show that SCOGCE strategies form a larger class of
equilibrium strategies; that is, whenever an SCONE exists, it is also an
SCOGCE. We demonstrate that sufficient conditions for the existence of SCOGCE
are related to the solvability of a set of coupled bi-linear matrix
inequalities. Using semi-definite programming relaxations, we provide linear
matrix inequality-based iterative algorithms for the synthesis of SCOGCE
strategies. Finally, we illustrate the performance of SCOGCE controllers with
numerical examples.

                                        <span>  This work addresses the problem of decentralized optimization on a compact
submanifold within a communication network comprising \(n\) nodes. Each node is
associated with a smooth, non-convex local cost function, and the collective
objective is to minimize the sum of these local cost functions. We focus on an
online scenario where local data arrives continuously in a streaming fashion,
eliminating the necessity for complete data storage. To tackle this problem, we
introduce a novel algorithm, the Decentralized Projected Riemannian Stochastic
Recursive Momentum (DPRSRM) method. Our approach leverages hybrid local
stochastic gradient estimators and utilizes network communication to maintain a
consensus on the global gradient. Notably, DPRSRM attains an oracle complexity
of \(\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-\frac{3}{2}})\), which surpasses the performance of
existing methods with complexities no better than
\(\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})\). Each node in the network requires only
\(\mathcal{O}(1)\) gradient evaluations per iteration, avoiding the need for
large batch gradient calculations or restarting procedures. Finally, we
validate the superior performance of our proposed algorithm through numerical
experiments, including applications in principal component analysis and
low-rank matrix completion, demonstrating its advantages over state-of-the-art
approaches.

                                        <span>  In this work, we consider convex optimization problems with smooth objective
function and nonsmooth functional constraints. We propose a new stochastic
gradient algorithm, called Stochastic Halfspace Approximation Method (SHAM), to
solve this problem, where at each iteration we first take a gradient step for
the objective function and then we perform a projection step onto one halfspace
approximation of a randomly chosen constraint. We propose various strategies to
create this stochastic halfspace approximation and we provide a unified
convergence analysis that yields new convergence rates for SHAM algorithm in
both optimality and feasibility criteria evaluated at some average point. In
particular, we derive convergence rates of order $\mathcal{O} (1/\sqrt{k})$,
when the objective function is only convex, and $\mathcal{O} (1/k)$ when the
objective function is strongly convex. The efficiency of SHAM is illustrated
through detailed numerical simulations.

                                        <span>  This paper studies stabilization of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems when
control actions can only be realized in finitely many directions where it is
possible to actuate uniformly or logarithmically extended positive scaling
factors in each direction. Furthermore, a nearest-action selection approach is
used to map the continuous measurements to a realizable action where we show
that the approach satisfies a weak sector condition for multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Using the notion of input-to-state stability,
under some assumptions imposed on the transfer function of the system, we show
that the closed-loop system converges to the target ball exponentially fast.
Moreover, when logarithmic extension for the scaling factors is realizable, the
closed-loop system is able to achieve asymptotic stability instead of only
practical stability. Finally, we present an example of the application that
confirms our analysis.

                                        <span>  We study the problem of finding an $\epsilon$-first-order stationary point
(FOSP) of a smooth function, given access only to gradient information. The
best-known gradient query complexity for this task, assuming both the gradient
and Hessian of the objective function are Lipschitz continuous, is
${O}(\epsilon^{-7/4})$. In this work, we propose a method with a gradient
complexity of ${O}(d^{1/4}\epsilon^{-13/8})$, where $d$ is the problem
dimension, leading to an improved complexity when $d = {O}(\epsilon^{-1/2})$.
To achieve this result, we design an optimization algorithm that, underneath,
involves solving two online learning problems. Specifically, we first
reformulate the task of finding a stationary point for a nonconvex problem as
minimizing the regret in an online convex optimization problem, where the loss
is determined by the gradient of the objective function. Then, we introduce a
novel optimistic quasi-Newton method to solve this online learning problem,
with the Hessian approximation update itself framed as an online learning
problem in the space of matrices. Beyond improving the complexity bound for
achieving an $\epsilon$-FOSP using a gradient oracle, our result provides the
first guarantee suggesting that quasi-Newton methods can potentially outperform
gradient descent-type methods in nonconvex settings.

                                        <span>  The fracturing-flooding technology is a new process for the development of
low-permeability oil reservoirs, achieving a series of successful applications
in oilfield production. However, existing numerical simulation methods for
pressure drive struggle to efficiently and accurately simulate the dynamic
changes in reservoir properties during the fracturing-flooding process,
particularly the expansion and closure of fractures within the reservoir. This
paper introduces a Darcy flow model with dual-porous and dual-permeable
characteristics based on seepage mechanics theory, utilizing two sets of rock
stress-sensitive parameter tables to describe the physical property changes of
the matrix and fractures during the fracturing-flooding process. Different
parameters are set for the X and Y directions to characterize the anisotropic
features of the reservoir. A numerical simulation method aimed at dynamic
analysis of fracturing-flooding is established, along with an automatic history
fitting method based on the CMA-ES algorithm to derive rock mechanics
parameters that align with actual block conditions.

inertial version including a relaxation step, and a second version considering
a double-inertial step with additional momentum. By applying NFBM to specific
monotone inclusions, we derive inertial and relaxed versions of algorithms such

Condat-V\~u, among others, thereby recovering and extending previous results
from the literature for solving monotone inclusions involving maximally

also present numerical experiments on image restoration, comparing the proposed

numerical convergence for larger step-sizes versus relaxation parameters and
introduce a restart strategy that incorporates larger step-sizes and inertial
steps to further enhance numerical convergence.

  To obtain our results, we generalize a recent optimization approach to

of updates. To apply this framework we develop optimization methods compatible

                                        <span>  In-memory computing (IMC) has been shown to be a promising approach for
solving binary optimization problems while significantly reducing energy and
latency. Building on the advantages of parallel computation, we propose an
IMC-compatible parallelism framework inspired by parallel tempering (PT),
enabling cross-replica communication to improve the performance of IMC solvers.
This framework enables an IMC solver not only to improve performance beyond
what can be achieved through parallelization, but also affords greater
flexibility for the search process with low hardware overhead. We justify that
the framework can be applied to almost any IMC solver. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the framework for the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem,
using the WalkSAT heuristic as a proxy for existing IMC solvers. The resulting
PT-inspired cooperative WalkSAT (PTIC-WalkSAT) algorithm outperforms the
traditional WalkSAT heuristic in terms of the iterations-to-solution in 76.3%
of the tested problem instances and its na\"ive parallel variant (PA-WalkSAT)
does so in 68.4% of the instances. An estimate of the energy overhead of the
PTIC framework for two hardware accelerator architectures indicates that in
both cases the overhead of running the PTIC framework would be less than 1% of
the total energy required to run each accelerator.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose a very efficient numerical method based on the
L-BFGS-B algorithm for identifying linear and nonlinear discrete-time
state-space models, possibly under $\ell_1$ and group-Lasso regularization for
reducing model complexity. For the identification of linear models, we show
that, compared to classical linear subspace methods, the approach often
provides better results, is much more general in terms of the loss and
regularization terms used (such as penalties for enforcing system stability),
and is also more stable from a numerical point of view. The proposed method not
only enriches the existing set of linear system identification tools but can
also be applied to identifying a very broad class of parametric nonlinear
state-space models, including recurrent neural networks. We illustrate the
approach on synthetic and experimental datasets and apply it to solve a
challenging industrial robot benchmark for nonlinear multi-input/multi-output
system identification. A Python implementation of the proposed identification
method is available in the package jax-sysid, available at
https://github.com/bemporad/jax-sysid.

                                        <span>  In LLM alignment and many other ML applications, one often faces the
Multi-Objective Fine-Tuning (MOFT) problem, i.e. fine-tuning an existing model
with datasets labeled w.r.t. different objectives simultaneously. To address
the challenge, we propose the HyperDPO framework, a conditioned one-shot
fine-tuning approach that extends the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
technique, originally developed for efficient LLM alignment with preference
data, to accommodate the MOFT settings. By substituting the Bradley-Terry-Luce
model in DPO with the Plackett-Luce model, our framework is capable of handling
a wide range of MOFT tasks that involve listwise ranking datasets. Compared
with previous approaches, HyperDPO enjoys an efficient one-shot training
process for profiling the Pareto front of auxiliary objectives, and offers
post-training control over trade-offs. Additionally, we propose a novel Hyper
Prompt Tuning design, that conveys continuous importance weight across
objectives to transformer-based models without altering their architecture, and
investigate the potential of temperature-conditioned networks for enhancing the
flexibility of post-training control. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the HyperDPO framework through its applications to various tasks,
including Learning-to-Rank (LTR) and LLM alignment, highlighting its viability
for large-scale ML deployments.

                                        <span>  We describe how the low-rank structure in an SDP can be exploited to reduce
the per-iteration cost of a convex primal-dual interior-point method down to
$O(n^{3})$ time and $O(n^{2})$ memory, even at very high accuracies. A
traditional difficulty is the dense Newton subproblem at each iteration, which
becomes progressively ill-conditioned as progress is made towards the solution.
Preconditioners have been proposed to improve conditioning, but these can be
expensive to set up, and fundamentally become ineffective at high accuracies,
as the preconditioner itself becomes increasingly ill-conditioned. Instead, we
present a well-conditioned reformulation of the Newton subproblem that is cheap
to set up, and whose condition number is guaranteed to remain bounded over all
iterations of the interior-point method. In theory, applying an inner iterative
method to the reformulation reduces the per-iteration cost of the outer
interior-point method to $O(n^{3})$ time and $O(n^{2})$ memory. We also present
a well-conditioned preconditioner that theoretically increases the outer
per-iteration cost to $O(n^{3}r^{3})$ time and $O(n^{2}r^{2})$ memory, where
$r$ is an upper-bound on the solution rank, but in practice greatly improves
the convergence of the inner iterations.

with bounded measurable input functions are considered. The problem of the
existence of periodic trajectories for these systems is formulated in the sense
of Carath\'eodory solutions. It is shown that, under the dominant linearization
assumption, the periodic boundary value problem admits a unique solution for
any admissible control. This solution can be obtained as the limit of the

technical assumptions, sufficient contraction conditions of the corresponding
generating operators are derived analytically. The proposed iterative approach
is applied for the computation of periodic solutions of a realistic chemical

consensus-based optimization methods (CBO) for global, derivative-free

to offer high-performance implementations of CBX methods that the community can
use directly, while on the other, providing a general interface that can
accommodate and be extended to further variations of the CBX family. Python and
Julia were selected as the leading high-level languages in terms of usage and
performance, as well as their popularity among the scientific computing
community. Both libraries have been developed with a common ethos, ensuring a
similar API and core functionality, while leveraging the strengths of each
language and writing idiomatic code.

                                        <span>  This paper studies Positivstellens\"atze and moment problems for sets $K$
that are given by universal quantifiers. Let $Q$ be a closed set and let $g =
(g_1,...,g_s)$ be a tuple of polynomials in two vector variables $x$ and $y$.
Then $K$ is described as the set of all points $x$ such that each $g_j(x, y)
\ge 0$ for all $y \in Q$. Fix a finite nonnegative Borel measure $\nu$ with
$supp(\nu) = Q$, and assume it satisfies the multivariate Carleman condition.
The first main result of the paper is a Positivstellensatz with universal
quantifiers: if a polynomial $f(x)$ is positive on $K$, then it belongs to the
quadratic module $QM(g,\nu)$ associated to $(g,\nu)$, under the archimedeanness
assumption on $QM(g,\nu)$. Here, $QM(g,\nu)$ denotes the quadratic module of
polynomials in $x$ that can be represented as \[\tau_0(x) + \int
\tau_1(x,y)g_1(x, y)\, d\nu(y) + \cdots + \int \tau_s(x,y) g_s(x, y)\, d\nu(y),
\] where each $\tau_j$ is a sum of squares polynomial.
  Second, necessary and sufficient conditions for a full (or truncated)
multisequence to admit a representing measure supported in $K$ are given. In
particular, the classical flat extension theorem of Curto and Fialkow is
generalized to truncated moment problems on such a set $K$. Finally,
applications of these results for solving semi-infinite optimization problems
are presented.

semidefinite programming hierarchy that detects when when no such joint state
exists. The hierarchy is complete, in the sense that it detects every
incompatible set of spectra. The refutations it provides are dimension-free,
certifying incompatibility in all local dimensions. The hierarchy also applies
to the sums of Hermitian matrices problem, the compatibility of local unitary
invariants, for certifying vanishing Kronecker coefficients, and to optimize
over equivariant state polynomials.

                                        <span>  Quantum computing is a fascinating interdisciplinary research field that
promises to revolutionize computing by efficiently solving previously
intractable problems. Recent years have seen tremendous progress on both the
experimental realization of quantum computing devices as well as the
development and implementation of quantum algorithms. Yet, realizing
computational advantages of quantum computers in practice remains a widely open
problem due to numerous fundamental challenges. Interestingly, many of these
challenges are connected to performance, robustness, scalability, optimization,
or feedback, all of which are central concepts in control theory. This paper
provides a tutorial introduction to quantum computing from the perspective of
control theory. We introduce the mathematical framework of quantum algorithms
ranging from basic elements including quantum bits and quantum gates to more
advanced concepts such as variational quantum algorithms and quantum errors.
The tutorial only requires basic knowledge of linear algebra and, in
particular, no prior exposure to quantum physics. Our main goal is to equip
readers with the mathematical basics required to understand and possibly solve
(control-related) problems in quantum computing. In particular, beyond the
tutorial introduction, we provide a list of research challenges in the field of
quantum computing and discuss their connections to control.

for fair classification in machine learning. In this framework, the fair
learning process is divided into three stages. Each stage aims to reduce
unfairness, such as disparate impact and disparate mistreatment, in the final
prediction. For the preprocessing stage, we present a resampling method that
addresses unfairness coming from data imbalances. The in-processing phase
consist of a classification method. This can be either one coming from the
MLJ.jl package, or a user defined one. For this phase, we incorporate fair ML
methods that can handle unfairness to a certain degree through their
optimization process. In the post-processing, we discuss the choice of the
cut-off value for fair prediction. With simulations, we show the performance of
the single phases and their combinations.

unknown multiplicative noise terms, are a major obstacle for reliable quantum
computing. In this paper, we present a framework for analyzing the robustness
of quantum algorithms against coherent control errors using Lipschitz bounds.
We derive worst-case fidelity bounds which show that the resilience against
coherent control errors is mainly influenced by the norms of the Hamiltonians
generating the individual gates. These bounds are explicitly computable even
for large circuits, and they can be used to guarantee fault-tolerance via
threshold theorems. Moreover, we apply our theoretical framework to derive a
novel guideline for robust quantum algorithm design and transpilation, which
amounts to reducing the norms of the Hamiltonians. Using the $3$-qubit Quantum
Fourier Transform as an example application, we demonstrate that this guideline
targets robustness more effectively than existing ones based on circuit depth
or gate count. Furthermore, we apply our framework to study the effect of
parameter regularization in variational quantum algorithms. The practicality of
the theoretical results is demonstrated via implementations in simulation and
on a quantum computer.

popular approach for several decades, with various benefits for multi-task
learning, the consideration of secondary goals such as sparsity, or
multicriteria hyperparameter tuning. However - as multi-objective optimization
is significantly more costly than single-objective optimization - the recent
focus on deep learning architectures poses considerable additional challenges
due to the very large number of parameters, strong nonlinearities and
stochasticity. This survey covers recent advancements in the area of
multi-objective deep learning. We introduce a taxonomy of existing methods -
based on the type of training algorithm as well as the decision maker's needs -
before listing recent advancements, and also successful applications. All three

                                        <span>  In this paper, we introduce a technique to enhance the computational
efficiency of solution algorithms for high-dimensional discrete
simulation-based optimization problems. The technique is based on innovative
adaptive partitioning strategies that partition the feasible region using
solutions that has already been simulated as well as prior knowledge of the
problem of interesting. We integrate the proposed strategies with the Empirical
Stochastic Branch-and-Bound framework proposed by Xu and Nelson (2013). This
combination leads to a general-purpose discrete simulation-based optimization
algorithm that is both globally convergent and has good small sample
(finite-time) performance. The proposed general-purpose discrete
simulation-based optimization algorithm is validated on a synthetic discrete
simulation-based optimization problem and is then used to address a real-world
car-sharing fleet assignment problem. Experiment results show that the proposed
strategy can increase the algorithm efficiency significantly.

                                        <span>  Nonconvex constrained optimization problems can be used to model a number of
machine learning problems, such as multi-class Neyman-Pearson classification
and constrained Markov decision processes. However, such kinds of problems are
challenging because both the objective and constraints are possibly nonconvex,
so it is difficult to balance the reduction of the loss value and reduction of
constraint violation. Although there are a few methods that solve this class of
problems, all of them are double-loop or triple-loop algorithms, and they
require oracles to solve some subproblems up to certain accuracy by tuning
multiple hyperparameters at each iteration. In this paper, we propose a novel
gradient descent and perturbed ascent (GDPA) algorithm to solve a class of
smooth nonconvex inequality constrained problems. The GDPA is a primal-dual
algorithm, which only exploits the first-order information of both the
objective and constraint functions to update the primal and dual variables in
an alternating way. The key feature of the proposed algorithm is that it is a
single-loop algorithm, where only two step-sizes need to be tuned. We show that
under a mild regularity condition GDPA is able to find Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
points of nonconvex functional constrained problems with convergence rate
guarantees. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first single-loop algorithm
that can solve the general nonconvex smooth problems with nonconvex inequality
constraints. Numerical results also showcase the superiority of GDPA compared
with the best-known algorithms (in terms of both stationarity measure and
feasibility of the obtained solutions).

safety constraints. Designing such filters as functions of visual observations
in uncertain and complex environments is challenging. Several deep
learning-based approaches to tackle this challenge have been proposed recently.
However, formally verifying that the learned filters satisfy critical
properties that enable them to guarantee the safety of the system is currently
beyond reach. Instead, in this work, motivated by the success of ensemble
methods in reinforcement learning, we empirically investigate the efficacy of
ensembles in enhancing the accuracy and the out-of-distribution generalization
of such filters, as a step towards more reliable ones. We experiment with
diverse pre-trained vision representation models as filter backbones, training
approaches, and output aggregation techniques. We compare the performance of
ensembles with different configurations against each other, their individual
member models, and large single-model baselines in distinguishing between safe
and unsafe states and controls in the DeepAccident dataset. Our results show
that diverse ensembles have better state and control classification accuracies
compared to individual models.

Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) directly within autonomous driving
contexts. However, the high costs and complexity of designing and training
end-to-end autonomous driving models make them challenging for many enterprises
and research entities. To address this, our study explores a seamless
integration of MLLMs into autonomous driving systems by proposing a Zero-Shot
Chain-of-Thought (Zero-Shot-CoT) prompt design named PKRD-CoT. PKRD-CoT is
based on the four fundamental capabilities of autonomous driving: perception,
knowledge, reasoning, and decision-making. This makes it particularly suitable
for understanding and responding to dynamic driving environments by mimicking
human thought processes step by step, thus enhancing decision-making in
real-time scenarios. Our design enables MLLMs to tackle problems without prior
experience, thereby increasing their utility within unstructured autonomous
driving environments. In experiments, we demonstrate the exceptional
performance of GPT-4.0 with PKRD-CoT across autonomous driving tasks,
highlighting its effectiveness in autonomous driving scenarios. Additionally,
our benchmark analysis reveals the promising viability of PKRD-CoT for other
MLLMs, such as Claude, LLava1.6, and Qwen-VL-Plus. Overall, this study
contributes a novel and unified prompt-design framework for GPT-4.0 and other
MLLMs in autonomous driving, while also rigorously evaluating the efficacy of
these widely recognized MLLMs in the autonomous driving domain through
comprehensive comparisons.

                                        <span>  In many security applications of cyber-physical systems, a system designer
must guarantee that critical missions are satisfied against attacks in the
sensors and actuators of the CPS. Traditional security design of CPSs often
assume that attackers have complete knowledge of the system. In this article,
we introduce a class of deception techniques and study how to leverage
asymmetric information created by deception to strengthen CPS security.
Consider an adversarial interaction between a CPS defender and an attacker, who
can perform sensor jamming attacks. To mitigate such attacks, the defender
introduces asymmetrical information by deploying a "hidden sensor," whose
presence is initially undisclosed but can be revealed if queried. We introduce
hypergames on graphs to model this game with asymmetric information. Building
on the solution concept called subjective rationalizable strategies in
hypergames, we identify two stages in the game: An initial game stage where the
defender commits to a strategy perceived rationalizable by the attacker until
he deviates from the equilibrium in the attacker's perceptual game; Upon the
deviation, a delay-attack game stage starts where the defender plays against
the attacker, who has a bounded delay in attacking the sensor being revealed.
Based on backward induction, we develop an algorithm that determines, for any
given state, if the defender can benefit from hiding a sensor and revealing it
later. If the answer is affirmative, the algorithm outputs a sensor revealing
strategy to determine when to reveal the sensor during dynamic interactions. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our deceptive strategies through two case
studies related to CPS security applications.

                                        <span>  The rise of intelligent autonomous systems, especially in robotics and
autonomous agents, has created a critical need for robust communication
middleware that can ensure real-time processing of extensive sensor data.
Current robotics middleware like Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 faces
challenges with nondeterminism and high communication latency when dealing with
large data across multiple subscribers on a multi-core compute platform. To
address these issues, we present High-Performance Robotic Middleware (HPRM),
built on top of the deterministic coordination language Lingua Franca (LF).
HPRM employs optimizations including an in-memory object store for efficient
zero-copy transfer of large payloads, adaptive serialization to minimize
serialization overhead, and an eager protocol with real-time sockets to reduce
handshake latency. Benchmarks show HPRM achieves up to 173x lower latency than
ROS2 when broadcasting large messages to multiple nodes. We then demonstrate
the benefits of HPRM by integrating it with the CARLA simulator and running
reinforcement learning agents along with object detection workloads. In the
CARLA autonomous driving application, HPRM attains 91.1% lower latency than
ROS2. The deterministic coordination semantics of HPRM, combined with its
optimized IPC mechanisms, enable efficient and predictable real-time
communication for intelligent autonomous systems.

                                        <span>  Scaling robot learning requires data collection pipelines that scale
favorably with human effort. In this work, we propose Crowdsourcing and
Amortizing Human Effort for Real-to-Sim-to-Real(CASHER), a pipeline for scaling
up data collection and learning in simulation where the performance scales
superlinearly with human effort. The key idea is to crowdsource digital twins
of real-world scenes using 3D reconstruction and collect large-scale data in
simulation, rather than the real-world. Data collection in simulation is
initially driven by RL, bootstrapped with human demonstrations. As the training
of a generalist policy progresses across environments, its generalization
capabilities can be used to replace human effort with model generated
demonstrations. This results in a pipeline where behavioral data is collected
in simulation with continually reducing human effort. We show that CASHER
demonstrates zero-shot and few-shot scaling laws on three real-world tasks
across diverse scenarios. We show that CASHER enables fine-tuning of
pre-trained policies to a target scenario using a video scan without any
additional human effort. See our project website:

                                        <span>  Deformable object manipulation remains a key challenge in developing
autonomous robotic systems that can be successfully deployed in real-world
scenarios. In this work, we explore the challenges of deformable object
manipulation through the task of sculpting clay into 3D shapes. We propose the
first coarse-to-fine autonomous sculpting system in which the sculpting agent
first selects how many and where to place discrete chunks of clay into the
workspace to create a coarse shape, and then iteratively refines the shape with
sequences of deformation actions. We leverage large language models for
sub-goal generation, and train a point cloud region-based action model to
predict robot actions from the desired point cloud sub-goals. Additionally, our
method is the first autonomous sculpting system that is a real-world text-to-3D
shaping pipeline without any explicit 3D goals or sub-goals provided to the
system. We demonstrate our method is able to successfully create a set of
simple shapes solely from text-based prompting. Furthermore, we explore
rigorously how to best quantify success for the text-to-3D sculpting task, and
compare existing text-image and text-point cloud similarity metrics to human
evaluations for this task. For experimental videos, human evaluation details,

subsea telerobotics, tracing back the transition from traditional first-person
"soda-straw" consoles (narrow field-of-view camera feed) to advanced interfaces
powered by gesture recognition, virtual reality, and natural language models.
First, we discuss various forms of subsea telerobotics applications, current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) interface systems, and the challenges they face in
robust underwater sensing, real-time estimation, and low-latency communication.
Through this analysis, we highlight how advanced HMIs facilitate intuitive
interactions between human operators and robots to overcome these challenges. A
detailed review then categorizes and evaluates the cutting-edge HMI systems
based on their offered features from both human perspectives (e.g., enhancing
operator control and situational awareness) and machine perspectives (e.g.,
improving safety, mission accuracy, and task efficiency). Moreover, we examine
the literature on bidirectional interaction and intelligent collaboration in
terms of sensory feedback and intuitive control mechanisms for both physical
and virtual interfaces. The paper concludes by identifying critical challenges,
open research questions, and future directions, emphasizing the need for
multidisciplinary collaboration in subsea telerobotics.

approach that examines the challenges due to user and environmental
uncertainty, and incorporates these into user studies. The scenarios highlight
how personalization can be achieved through more human-robot collaboration,
particularly in relation to individuals with visual, physical, cognitive,
auditory impairments, clinical needs, environmental factors (noise, light
levels, clutter), and daily living activities. Our goal is for this
contribution to prompt reflection and aid in the design of improved robots
(embodiment, sensors, actuation, cognition) and their behavior, and we aim to
introduces a groundbreaking strategy to enhance human-robot collaboration,
addressing the complexities of decision-making under uncertainty through a
Scenario analysis approach. By emphasizing user-centered design principles and
offering actionable solutions to real-world challenges, this work aims to

progress in perception, planning, and control. However, evaluating individual
components does not fully reflect the performance of entire systems,
highlighting the need for more holistic assessment methods. This motivates the
development of HUGSIM, a closed-loop, photo-realistic, and real-time simulator
for evaluating autonomous driving algorithms. We achieve this by lifting
captured 2D RGB images into the 3D space via 3D Gaussian Splatting, improving
the rendering quality for closed-loop scenarios, and building the closed-loop
environment. In terms of rendering, We tackle challenges of novel view
synthesis in closed-loop scenarios, including viewpoint extrapolation and
360-degree vehicle rendering. Beyond novel view synthesis, HUGSIM further
enables the full closed simulation loop, dynamically updating the ego and actor
states and observations based on control commands. Moreover, HUGSIM offers a
comprehensive benchmark across more than 70 sequences from KITTI-360, Waymo,
nuScenes, and PandaSet, along with over 400 varying scenarios, providing a fair
and realistic evaluation platform for existing autonomous driving algorithms.
HUGSIM not only serves as an intuitive evaluation benchmark but also unlocks
the potential for fine-tuning autonomous driving algorithms in a photorealistic
closed-loop setting.

                                        <span>  Performing complex tasks in open environments remains challenging for robots,
even when using large language models (LLMs) as the core planner. Many
LLM-based planners are inefficient due to their large number of parameters and
prone to inaccuracies because they operate in open-loop systems. We think the
reason is that only applying LLMs as planners is insufficient. In this work, we
propose DaDu-E, a robust closed-loop planning framework for embodied AI robots.
Specifically, DaDu-E is equipped with a relatively lightweight LLM, a set of
encapsulated robot skill instructions, a robust feedback system, and memory
augmentation. Together, these components enable DaDu-E to (i) actively perceive
and adapt to dynamic environments, (ii) optimize computational costs while
maintaining high performance, and (iii) recover from execution failures using
its memory and feedback mechanisms. Extensive experiments on real-world and
simulated tasks show that DaDu-E achieves task success rates comparable to
embodied AI robots with larger models as planners like COME-Robot, while
reducing computational requirements by $6.6 \times$. Users are encouraged to

                                        <span>  We study how to synthesize a robust and safe policy for autonomous systems
under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks in adversarial settings against unknown
dynamic agents. To ensure the worst-case STL satisfaction, we propose STLGame,
a framework that models the multi-agent system as a two-player zero-sum game,
where the ego agents try to maximize the STL satisfaction and other agents
minimize it. STLGame aims to find a Nash equilibrium policy profile, which is
the best case in terms of robustness against unseen opponent policies, by using
the fictitious self-play (FSP) framework. FSP iteratively converges to a Nash
profile, even in games set in continuous state-action spaces. We propose a
gradient-based method with differentiable STL formulas, which is crucial in
continuous settings to approximate the best responses at each iteration of FSP.
We show this key aspect experimentally by comparing with reinforcement
learning-based methods to find the best response. Experiments on two standard
dynamical system benchmarks, Ackermann steering vehicles and autonomous drones,
demonstrate that our converged policy is almost unexploitable and robust to
various unseen opponents' policies. All code and additional experimental
results can be found on our project website:

can effectively perceive the geometric shape of objects and the force
information during the contact process, thus helping robots acquire
higher-dimensional tactile data. Vision-based tactile sensor simulation
supports the acquisition and understanding of tactile information without
physical sensors by accurately capturing and analyzing contact behavior and
physical properties. However, the complexity of contact dynamics and lighting
modeling limits the accurate reproduction of real sensor responses in
simulations, making it difficult to meet the needs of different sensor setups
and affecting the reliability and effectiveness of strategy transfer to
practical applications. In this letter, we propose a contact-condition guided
diffusion model that maps RGB images of objects and contact force data to
high-fidelity, detail-rich vision-based tactile sensor images. Evaluations show
that the three-channel tactile images generated by this method achieve a 60.58%
reduction in mean squared error and a 38.1% reduction in marker displacement
error compared to existing approaches based on lighting model and mechanical
model, validating the effectiveness of our approach. The method is successfully
applied to various types of tactile vision sensors and can effectively generate
corresponding tactile images under complex loads. Additionally, it demonstrates
outstanding reconstruction of fine texture features of objects in a Montessori
tactile board texture generation task.

                                        <span>  Model predictive control (MPC) has become increasingly popular for the
control of robot manipulators due to its improved performance compared to
instantaneous control approaches. However, tuning these controllers remains a
considerable hurdle. To address this hurdle, we propose a practical MPC
formulation which retains the more interpretable tuning parameters of the
instantaneous control approach while enhancing the performance through a
prediction horizon. The formulation is motivated at hand of a simple example,
highlighting the practical tuning challenges associated with typical MPC
approaches and showing how the proposed formulation alleviates these
challenges. Furthermore, the formulation is validated on a surface-following
task, illustrating its applicability to industrially relevant scenarios.
Although the research is presented in the context of robot manipulator control,
we anticipate that the formulation is more broadly applicable.

capability needed by autonomous cars to enable safe driving decisions.
Recently, purely vision-based solutions have gained increasing research
interest. In particular, approaches extracting a bird's eye view (BEV) from
multiple cameras have demonstrated great performance for spatial understanding.
This paper addresses the dependency on learned positional encodings to
correlate image and BEV feature map elements for transformer-based methods. We
propose leveraging epipolar geometric constraints to model the relationship
between cameras and the BEV by Epipolar Attention Fields. They are incorporated
into the attention mechanism as a novel attribution term, serving as an
alternative to learned positional encodings. Experiments show that our method
EAFormer outperforms previous BEV approaches by 2% mIoU for map semantic
segmentation and exhibits superior generalization capabilities compared to
implicitly learning the camera configuration.

modern vision systems in many applications such as Augmented Reality,
autonomous driving, and robotics. While research in model-based 6D object pose
estimation has delivered promising results, model-free methods are hindered by
the high computational load in rendering and inferring consistent poses of
arbitrary objects in a live RGB-D video stream. To address this issue, we
present 6DOPE-GS, a novel method for online 6D object pose estimation \&
tracking with a single RGB-D camera by effectively leveraging advances in
Gaussian Splatting. Thanks to the fast differentiable rendering capabilities of
Gaussian Splatting, 6DOPE-GS can simultaneously optimize for 6D object poses
and 3D object reconstruction. To achieve the necessary efficiency and accuracy
for live tracking, our method uses incremental 2D Gaussian Splatting with an
intelligent dynamic keyframe selection procedure to achieve high spatial object
coverage and prevent erroneous pose updates. We also propose an opacity
statistic-based pruning mechanism for adaptive Gaussian density control, to
ensure training stability and efficiency. We evaluate our method on the HO3D
and YCBInEOAT datasets and show that 6DOPE-GS matches the performance of
state-of-the-art baselines for model-free simultaneous 6D pose tracking and
reconstruction while providing a 5$\times$ speedup. We also demonstrate the
method's suitability for live, dynamic object tracking and reconstruction in a
real-world setting.

embodied agents, however many current approaches are computationally expensive.
In this paper, we reexamine the critical design choices established in previous
works to optimize both efficiency and performance. We propose a general scene
graph framework and conduct three studies that focus on image pre-processing,
feature fusion, and feature selection. Our findings reveal that commonly used
image pre-processing techniques provide minimal performance improvement while
tripling computation (on a per object view basis). We also show that averaging
feature labels across different views significantly degrades performance. We
study alternative feature selection strategies that enhance performance without
adding unnecessary computational costs. Based on our findings, we introduce a
computationally balanced approach for 3D point cloud segmentation with
per-object features. The approach matches state-of-the-art classification
accuracy while achieving a threefold reduction in computation.

                                        <span>  For high-level geo-spatial applications and intelligent robotics, accurate
global pose information is of crucial importance. Map-aided localization is an
important and universal approach to overcome the limitations of global
navigation satellite system (GNSS) in challenging environments. However,
current solutions face challenges in terms of mapping flexibility, storage
burden and re-localization performance. In this work, we present SF-Loc, a
lightweight visual mapping and map-aided localization system, whose core idea
is the map representation based on sparse frames with dense (though
downsampled) depth, termed as visual structure frames. In the mapping phase,
multi-sensor dense bundle adjustment (MS-DBA) is applied to construct
geo-referenced visual structure frames. The local co-visbility is checked to
keep the map sparsity and achieve incremental mapping. In the localization
phase, coarse-to-fine vision-based localization is performed, in which
multi-frame information and the map distribution are fully integrated. To be
specific, the concept of spatially smoothed similarity (SSS) is proposed to
overcome the place ambiguity, and pairwise frame matching is applied for
efficient and robust pose estimation. Experimental results on both public and
self-made datasets verify the effectiveness of the system. In complex urban
road scenarios, the map size is down to 3 MB per kilometer and stable
decimeter-level re-localization can be achieved. The code will be made
open-source soon (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/SF-Loc).

                                        <span>  Due to the strong nonlinearity and nonholonomic dynamics, despite that
various general trajectory optimization methods have been presented, few of
them can guarantee efficient compu-tation and physical feasibility for
relatively complicated fixed-wing UAV dynamics. Aiming at this issue, this
paper investigates a differential flatness-based trajectory optimization method
for fixed-wing UAVs (DFTO-FW), which transcribes the trajectory optimization
into a lightweight, unconstrained, gradient-analytical optimization with linear
time complexity in each itera-tion to achieve fast trajectory generation.
Through differential flat characteristics analysis and polynomial
parameterization, the customized trajectory representation is presented, which
implies the equality constraints to avoid the heavy computational burdens of
solving complex dynamics. Through the design of integral performance costs and
deduction of analytical gradients, the original trajectory optimization is
transcribed into an uncon-strained, gradient-analytical optimization with
linear time com-plexity to further improve efficiency. The simulation
experi-ments illustrate the superior efficiency of the DFTO-FW, which takes
sub-second CPU time against other competitors by orders of magnitude to
generate fixed-wing UAV trajectories in ran-domly generated obstacle
environments.

key component in enabling mixed reality, wearable computing, and embodied AI.
Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach
that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric
capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets approaching the former two
problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated objects is
underrepresented and only partly covered by current works. In this work, we
address this shortcoming and introduce (1) an expertly curated dataset in the
Universal Scene Description (USD) format, featuring high-quality manual
annotations, for instance, segmentation and articulation on 280 indoor scenes;
(2) a learning-based model together with a novel baseline capable of predicting
part segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes,
including motion type, articulated and interactable parts, and motion
parameters; (3) a benchmark serving to compare upcoming methods for the task at
hand. Overall, our dataset provides 8 types of annotations - object and part
segmentations, motion types, movable and interactable parts, motion parameters,
connectivity, and object mass annotations. With its broad and high-quality
annotations, the data provides the basis for holistic 3D scene understanding
models. All data is provided in the USD format, allowing interoperability and
easy integration with downstream tasks. We provide open access to our dataset,
benchmark, and method's source code.

                                        <span>  Sparse programming is an important tool in robotics, for example in real-time
sparse inverse kinematic control with a minimum number of active joints, or
autonomous goal selection. However, current approaches are limited to real-time
control without consideration of the underlying non-linear problem. This
prevents the application to non-linear problems like inverse kinematic planning
while the robot autonomously chooses from a set of potential goal positions.
Instead, kinematic reachability approximations are used while the robot's whole
body motion is considered separately. Furthermore, the sparse constraints are
not prioritized for intuitive problem formulation. Lastly, the computational
effort of the used standard solvers is cubically dependent on the number of
constraints which is problematic in the presence of a large number of possible
goals. In this work, we address sparse hierarchical non-linear programs with
tools from hierarchical non-linear programming to gain a holistic understanding
of the problem at hand. The resulting sequential sparse hierarchical quadratic
programming solver scales linearly in the number of constraints and enables the
formulation of sparse non-linear equality and inequality constraints on any
priority level without feasibility requirements. This enables efficient robot
sparse hierarchical inverse kinematic planning and control with autonomous goal
selection from a high number of possible goal positions without any
reachability approximations.

                                        <span>  Cross-modal localization has drawn increasing attention in recent years,
while the visual relocalization in prior LiDAR maps is less studied. Related
methods usually suffer from inconsistency between the 2D texture and 3D
geometry, neglecting the intensity features in the LiDAR point cloud. In this
paper, we propose a cross-modal visual relocalization system in prior LiDAR
maps utilizing intensity textures, which consists of three main modules: map
projection, coarse retrieval, and fine relocalization. In the map projection
module, we construct the database of intensity channel map images leveraging
the dense characteristic of panoramic projection. The coarse retrieval module
retrieves the top-K most similar map images to the query image from the
database, and retains the top-K' results by covisibility clustering. The fine
relocalization module applies a two-stage 2D-3D association and a covisibility
inlier selection method to obtain robust correspondences for 6DoF pose
estimation. The experimental results on our self-collected datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness in both place recognition and pose estimation tasks.

                                        <span>  Multi Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is critical for coordinating multiple robots
in shared environments, yet robust execution of generated plans remains
challenging due to operational uncertainties. The Action Dependency Graph (ADG)
framework offers a way to ensure correct action execution by establishing
precedence-based dependencies between wait and move actions retrieved from a
MAPF planning result. The original construction algorithm is not only
inefficient, with a quadratic worst-case time complexity it also results in a
network with many redundant dependencies between actions. This paper introduces
two key improvements to the ADG framework. First, we prove that wait actions
are generally redundant and show that removing them can lead to faster overall
plan execution on real robot systems. Second, we propose an optimized ADG
construction algorithm, termed Sparse Candidate Partitioning (SCP), which skips
unnecessary dependencies and lowers the time complexity to quasi-linear,
thereby significantly improving construction speed.

framework that focuses on motion prediction, decision-making, and trajectory
planning. Specifically, we formulate decision-making and trajectory planning as
a differentiable nonlinear optimization problem, which ensures compatibility
with learning-based modules to establish an end-to-end trainable architecture.
This optimization introduces explicit objectives related to safety, traveling
efficiency, and riding comfort, guiding the learning process in our proposed
pipeline. Intrinsic constraints resulting from the decision-making task are
integrated into the optimization formulation and preserved throughout the
learning process. By integrating the differentiable optimizer with a neural
network predictor, the proposed framework is end-to-end trainable, aligning
various driving tasks with ultimate performance goals defined by the
optimization objectives. The proposed framework is trained and validated using
the Waymo Open Motion dataset. The open-loop testing reveals that while the
planning outcomes using our method do not always resemble the expert
trajectory, they consistently outperform baseline approaches with improved
safety, traveling efficiency, and riding comfort. The closed-loop testing
further demonstrates the effectiveness of optimizing decisions and improving
driving performance. Ablation studies demonstrate that the initialization
provided by the learning-based prediction module is essential for the
convergence of the optimizer as well as the overall driving performance.

robot localization and scene understanding. However, real-time construction of
semantic maps requires mobile edge devices with extremely high computing power,
which are expensive and limit the widespread application of semantic mapping.
In order to address this limitation, inspired by cloud-edge collaborative
computing and the high transmission efficiency of semantic communication, this
paper proposes a method to achieve real-time semantic mapping tasks with
limited-resource mobile devices. Specifically, we design an encoding-decoding
semantic communication framework for real-time semantic mapping tasks under
limited-resource situations. In addition, considering the impact of different
channel conditions on communication, this paper designs a module based on the
attention mechanism to achieve stable data transmission under various channel
conditions. In terms of simulation experiments, based on the TUM dataset, it
was verified that the system has an error of less than 0.1% compared to the
groundtruth in mapping and localization accuracy and is superior to some novel
semantic communication algorithms in real-time performance and channel
adaptation. Besides, we implement a prototype system to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed framework and designed module in real indoor
scenarios. The results show that our system can complete real-time semantic
mapping tasks for common indoor objects (chairs, computers, people, etc.) with
a limited-resource device, and the mapping update time is less than 1 second.

(SfM) and Visual SLAM (VSLAM) systems, but is universally reliant on
high-quality geometric ground truth -- a resource that is not only costly and
time-intensive but, in many cases, entirely unobtainable. This dependency on
ground truth restricts SfM and SLAM applications across diverse environments
and limits scalability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a
novel ground-truth-free (GTF) evaluation methodology that eliminates the need
for geometric ground truth, instead using sensitivity estimation via sampling
from both original and noisy versions of input images. Our approach shows
strong correlation with traditional ground-truth-based benchmarks and supports
GTF hyperparameter tuning. Removing the need for ground truth opens up new
opportunities to leverage a much larger number of dataset sources, and for
self-supervised and online tuning, with the potential for a data-driven
breakthrough analogous to what has occurred in generative AI.

mobility in roads, factories and warehouses. The rapidly exploring random tree
(RRT) algorithms are popular in multi-robot motion planning. However,
generating the graph configuration space and searching in the composite tensor
configuration space is computationally expensive for large number of sample
points. In this paper, we propose a new evolutionary-based algorithm using a
parametric lattice-based configuration and the discrete-based RRT for
collision-free multi-robot planning at intersections. Our computational
experiments using complex planning intersection scenarios have shown the
feasibility and the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to seven
other related approaches. Our results offer new sampling and representation
mechanisms to render optimization-based approaches for multi-robot navigation.

                                        <span>  We consider the problem of estimating object pose and shape from an RGB-D
image. Our first contribution is to introduce CRISP, a category-agnostic object
pose and shape estimation pipeline. The pipeline implements an encoder-decoder
model for shape estimation. It uses FiLM-conditioning for implicit shape
reconstruction and a DPT-based network for estimating pose-normalized points
for pose estimation. As a second contribution, we propose an optimization-based
pose and shape corrector that can correct estimation errors caused by a domain
gap. Observing that the shape decoder is well behaved in the convex hull of
known shapes, we approximate the shape decoder with an active shape model, and
show that this reduces the shape correction problem to a constrained linear
least squares problem, which can be solved efficiently by an interior point
algorithm. Third, we introduce a self-training pipeline to perform
self-supervised domain adaptation of CRISP. The self-training is based on a
correct-and-certify approach, which leverages the corrector to generate
pseudo-labels at test time, and uses them to self-train CRISP. We demonstrate
CRISP (and the self-training) on YCBV, SPE3R, and NOCS datasets. CRISP shows
high performance on all the datasets. Moreover, our self-training is capable of
bridging a large domain gap. Finally, CRISP also shows an ability to generalize
to unseen objects. Code and pre-trained models will be available on
https://web.mit.edu/sparklab/research/crisp_object_pose_shape/.

                                        <span>  In the field of autonomous driving or robotics, simultaneous localization and
mapping (SLAM) and multi-object tracking (MOT) are two fundamental problems and
are generally applied separately. Solutions to SLAM and MOT usually rely on
certain assumptions, such as the static environment assumption for SLAM and the
accurate ego-vehicle pose assumption for MOT. But in complex dynamic
environments, it is difficult or even impossible to meet these assumptions.
Therefore, the SLAMMOT, i.e., simultaneous localization, mapping, and moving
object tracking, integrated system of SLAM and object tracking, has emerged for
autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments. However, many conventional SLAMMOT
solutions directly perform data association on the predictions and detections
for object tracking, but ignore their quality. In practice, inaccurate
predictions caused by continuous multi-frame missed detections in temporary
occlusion scenarios, may degrade the performance of tracking, thereby affecting
SLAMMOT. To address this challenge, this paper presents a LiDAR SLAMMOT based
on confidence-guided data association (Conf SLAMMOT) method, which tightly
couples the LiDAR SLAM and the confidence-guided data association based
multi-object tracking into a graph optimization backend for estimating the
state of the ego-vehicle and objects simultaneously. The confidence of
prediction and detection are applied in the factor graph-based multi-object
tracking for its data association, which not only avoids the performance
degradation caused by incorrect initial assignments in some filter-based
methods but also handles issues such as continuous missed detection in tracking
while also improving the overall performance of SLAMMOT. Various comparative
experiments demonstrate the superior advantages of Conf SLAMMOT, especially in
scenes with some missed detections.

                                        <span>  The automatic design of embodied agents (e.g. robots) has existed for 31
years and is experiencing a renaissance of interest in the literature. To date
however, the field has remained narrowly focused on two kinds of anatomically
simple robots: (1) fully rigid, jointed bodies; and (2) fully soft, jointless
bodies. Here we bridge these two extremes with the open ended creation of
terrestrial endoskeletal robots: deformable soft bodies that leverage jointed
internal skeletons to move efficiently across land. Simultaneous de novo
generation of external and internal structures is achieved by (i) modeling 3D
endoskeletal body plans as integrated collections of elastic and rigid cells
that directly attach to form soft tissues anchored to compound rigid bodies;
(ii) encoding these discrete mechanical subsystems into a continuous yet
coherent latent embedding; (iii) optimizing the sensorimotor coordination of
each decoded design using model-free reinforcement learning; and (iv)
navigating this smooth yet highly non-convex latent manifold using evolutionary
strategies. This yields an endless stream of novel species of "higher robots"
that, like all higher animals, harness the mechanical advantages of both
elastic tissues and skeletal levers for terrestrial travel. It also provides a
plug-and-play experimental platform for benchmarking evolutionary design and
representation learning algorithms in complex hierarchical embodied systems.

(VLA) models are transformative in automating complex decision-making across
applications by interpreting multi-modal data. However, scaling these models
greatly increases computational costs, which presents challenges in fields like
robot manipulation and autonomous driving that require quick, accurate
responses. To address the need for deployment on resource-limited hardware, we
propose a new quantization framework for IL-based policy models that fine-tunes
parameters to enhance robustness against low-bit precision errors during
training, thereby maintaining efficiency and reliability under constrained
conditions. Our evaluations with representative robot manipulation for 4-bit
weight-quantization on a real edge GPU demonstrate that our framework achieves
up to 2.5x speedup and 2.5x energy savings while preserving accuracy. For 4-bit
weight and activation quantized self-driving models, the framework achieves up
to 3.7x speedup and 3.1x energy saving on a low-end GPU. These results
highlight the practical potential of deploying IL-based policy models on
resource-constrained devices.

                                        <span>  Dynamic game theory is an increasingly popular tool for modeling multi-agent,
e.g. human-robot, interactions. Game-theoretic models presume that each agent
wishes to minimize a private cost function that depends on others' actions.
These games typically evolve over a fixed time horizon, which specifies the
degree to which all agents care about the distant future. In practical
settings, however, decision-makers may vary in their degree of
short-sightedness. We conjecture that quantifying and estimating each agent's
short-sightedness from online data will enable safer and more efficient
interactions with other agents. To this end, we frame this inference problem as
an inverse dynamic game. We consider a specific parametrization of each agent's
objective function that smoothly interpolates myopic and farsighted planning.
Games of this form are readily transformed into parametric mixed
complementarity problems; we exploit the directional differentiability of
solutions to these problems with respect to their hidden parameters in order to
solve for agents' short-sightedness. We conduct several experiments simulating
human behavior at a real-world crosswalk. The results of these experiments
clearly demonstrate that by explicitly inferring agents' short-sightedness, we
can recover more accurate game-theoretic models, which ultimately allow us to
make better predictions of agents' behavior. Specifically, our results show up
to a 30% more accurate prediction of myopic behavior compared to the baseline.

prostheses. Previous work has shown that aspects of prosthetic hand, wrist, or
elbow control can be improved through "intelligent" control, by combining
movement-based or gaze-based intent estimation with low-level robotic autonomy.
However, no such solutions exist for whole-arm control. Moreover, hardware
platforms for advanced prosthetic control are expensive, and existing
simulation platforms are not well-designed for integration with robotics
software frameworks. We present the Prosthetic Arm Control Testbed (ProACT), a
platform for evaluating intelligent control methods for prosthetic arms in an
immersive (Augmented Reality) simulation setting. We demonstrate the use of
ProACT through preliminary studies, with non-amputee participants performing an
adapted Box-and-Blocks task with and without intent estimation. We further
discuss how our observations may inform the design of prosthesis control
methods, as well as the design of future studies using the platform. To the
best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first study of semi-autonomous
control for complex whole-arm prostheses, the first study including sequential
task modeling in the context of wearable prosthetic arms, and the first testbed
of its kind. Towards the goal of supporting future research in intelligent
prosthetics, the system is built upon on existing open-source frameworks for
robotics, and is available at https://arm.stanford.edu/proact.

                                        <span>  We introduce a new bounding approach called Continuity* C*, which provides
optimality guarantees for the Moving-Target Traveling Salesman Problem
(MT-TSP). Our approach relaxes the continuity constraints on the agent's tour
by partitioning the targets' trajectories into smaller segments. This allows
the agent to arrive at any point within a segment and depart from any point in
the same segment when visiting each target. This formulation enables us to pose
the bounding problem as a Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP) on a
graph, where the cost of traveling along an edge requires solving a new problem
called the Shortest Feasible Travel (SFT). We present various methods for
computing bounds for the SFT problem, leading to several variants of C*. We
first prove that the proposed algorithms provide valid lower-bounds for the
MT-TSP. Additionally, we provide computational results to validate the
performance of all C* variants on instances with up to 15 targets. For the
special case where targets move along straight lines, we compare our C*
variants with a mixed-integer Second Order Conic Program (SOCP) based method,
the current state-of-the-art solver for the MT-TSP. While the SOCP-based method
performs well on instances with 5 and 10 targets, C* outperforms it on
instances with 15 targets. For the general case, on average, our approaches
find feasible solutions within approximately 4.5% of the lower-bounds for the
tested instances.

                                        <span>  We study the Monotone Sliding Reconfiguration (MSR) problem, in which
$\textit{labeled}$ pairwise interior-disjoint objects in a planar workspace
need to be brought $\textit{one by one}$ from their initial positions to given
target positions, without causing collisions. That is, at each step only one
object moves to its respective target, where it stays thereafter. MSR is a
natural special variant of Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP) and related
reconfiguration problems, many of which are known to be computationally hard. A
key question is identifying the minimal mitigating assumptions that enable
efficient algorithms for such problems. We first show that despite the
monotonicity requirement, MSR remains a computationally hard MRMP problem. We
then provide additional hardness results for MSR that rule out several natural
assumptions. For example, we show that MSR remains hard without obstacles in
the workspace. On the positive side, we introduce a family of MSR instances
that always have a solution through a novel structural assumption pertaining to
the graphs underlying the start and target configuration -- we require that
these graphs are spannable by a forest of full binary trees (SFFBT). We use our
assumption to obtain efficient MSR algorithms for unit discs and 2D grid
settings. Notably, our assumption does not require separation between
start/target positions, which is a standard requirement in efficient and
complete MRMP algorithms. Instead, we (implicitly) require separation between
$\textit{groups}$ of these positions, thereby pushing the boundary of
efficiently solvable instances toward denser scenarios.

segmenting novel object instances given a few examples of each instance. We
propose a unified, simple yet effective framework (NIDS-Net) comprising object
proposal generation, embedding creation for both instance templates and
proposal regions, and embedding matching for instance label assignment.
Leveraging recent advancements in large vision methods, we utilize Grounding
DINO and Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain object proposals with accurate
bounding boxes and masks. Central to our approach is the generation of
high-quality instance embeddings. We utilize foreground feature averages of
patch embeddings from the DINOv2 ViT backbone, followed by refinement through a
weight adapter mechanism that we introduce. We show experimentally that our
weight adapter can adjust the embeddings locally within their feature space and
effectively limit overfitting in the few-shot setting. This methodology enables
a straightforward matching strategy, resulting in significant performance
gains. Our framework surpasses current state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
notable improvements of 22.3, 46.2, 10.3, and 24.0 in average precision (AP)
across four detection datasets. In instance segmentation tasks on seven core
datasets of the BOP challenge, our method is around 4.5 times faster than the
leading published RGB method and surpasses it by 3.6 AP. NIDS-Net is about 5.7
times faster than the top RGB-D method while maintaining competitive
performance. Project Page: https://irvlutd.github.io/NIDSNet/

it remains a challenge for them to perform tasks both effectively and safely.
The fact that performance and safety can sometimes be competing objectives
renders the cooptimization between them difficult. One school of thought is to
treat this cooptimization as a constrained optimal control problem with a
performance-oriented objective function and safety as a constraint. However,
solving this constrained optimal control problem for general nonlinear systems
remains challenging. In this work, we use the general framework of constrained
optimal control, but given the safety state constraint, we convert it into an
equivalent control constraint, resulting in a state and time-dependent
control-constrained optimal control problem. This equivalent optimal control
problem can readily be solved using the dynamic programming principle. We show
the corresponding value function is a viscosity solution of a certain
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Partial Differential Equation (HJB-PDE). Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with a two-dimensional case
study, and the experiment shows that the controller synthesized using our
method consistently outperforms the baselines, both in safety and performance.

real-world scenarios, limiting the effective evaluation of autonomous driving
systems. We introduce Versatile Behavior Diffusion (VBD), a novel traffic
scenario generation framework that utilizes diffusion generative models to
predict scene-consistent and controllable multi-agent interactions in
closed-loop settings. VBD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo
Sim Agents Benchmark and can effectively produce realistic and coherent traffic
behaviors with complex agent interactions under diverse environmental
conditions. Furthermore, VBD offers inference-time scenario editing through
multi-step refinement guided by behavior priors and model-based optimization
objectives. This capability allows for controllable multi-agent behavior
generation, accommodating a wide range of user requirements across various
traffic simulation applications. Despite being trained solely on publicly
available datasets representing typical traffic conditions, we introduce
conflict-prior and game-theoretic guidance approaches that enable the creation
of interactive, long-tail safety-critical scenarios, which is essential for
comprehensive testing and validation of autonomous vehicles. Lastly, we provide
in-depth insights into effective training and inference strategies for
diffusion-based traffic scenario generation models, highlighting best practices

                                        <span>  We propose Waymo Open Motion Dataset-Reasoning (WOMD-Reasoning), a
comprehensive large-scale dataset with 3 million Q&As built on WOMD focusing on
describing and reasoning interactions and intentions in driving scenarios.
Existing language datasets for driving primarily capture interactions caused by
close distances. However, interactions induced by traffic rules and human
intentions, which can occur over long distances, are yet sufficiently covered.
To address this, WOMD-Reasoning presents by far the largest multi-modal Q&A
dataset on real-world driving scenarios, covering a wide range of driving
topics from map descriptions and motion status descriptions to narratives and
analyses of agents' interactions, behaviors, and intentions. We further
introduce Motion-LLaVA, a motion-language model fine-tuned on the proposed
dataset with robust interaction reasoning capabilities. We benchmark its
performance across various configurations including different input modalities,
reasoning techniques, and network architectures. The robust, diverse, and
multi-modal nature of WOMD-Reasoning highlights its potential to advance future
autonomous driving research and enable a broad range of applications. The
dataset and its vision modal extension are available at
https://waymo.com/open/download, and the codes & prompts to build it are
available at https://github.com/yhli123/WOMD-Reasoning.

extreme conditions and limited accessibility, raise the need for robust and
reliable techniques to identify and prevent satellite faults. Fault detection
methods in the space sector are required to ensure mission success and to
protect valuable assets. In this context, this paper proposes an Artificial
Intelligence (AI) based fault detection methodology and evaluates its
performance on ADAPT (Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics Testbed), an
Electrical Power System (EPS) dataset, crafted in laboratory by NASA. Our study
focuses on the application of a physics-informed (PI) real-valued non-volume
preserving (Real NVP) model for fault detection in space systems. The efficacy
of this method is systematically compared against other AI approaches such as
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Autoencoder-based techniques. Results show that
our physics-informed approach outperforms existing methods of fault detection,
demonstrating its suitability for addressing the unique challenges of satellite
EPS sub-system faults. Furthermore, we unveil the competitive advantage of
physics-informed loss in AI models to address specific space needs, namely
robustness, reliability, and power constraints, crucial for space exploration
and satellite missions.

mission success and safeguarding valuable assets. This work proposes a novel
approach leveraging Physics-Informed Real NVP neural networks, renowned for
their ability to model complex and high-dimensional distributions, augmented

Results indicate significant performance improvements across all settings. In

frameworks, our system integrates multiple sensors with advanced computer
vision algorithms to help users walk outside reliably. The system can
efficiently complete various tasks, including navigating to specific locations,
passing through obstacle regions, and crossing intersections. Specifically, we
also use ultrasonic sensors and depth cameras to enhance obstacle avoidance
performance. The path planning module is designed to find the locally optimal
route based on various feedback and the user's current state. To evaluate the
performance of the proposed system, we design several experiments under
different scenarios. The results show that the system can help users walk
efficiently and independently in complex situations.

                                        <span>  In contrast to conventional robots, accurately modeling the kinematics and
statics of continuum robots is challenging due to partially unknown material
properties, parasitic effects, or unknown forces acting on the continuous body.
Consequentially, state estimation approaches that utilize additional sensor
information to predict the shape of continuum robots have garnered significant
interest. This paper presents a novel approach to state estimation for systems
with multiple coupled continuum robots, which allows estimating the shape and
strain variables of multiple continuum robots in an arbitrary coupled topology.
Simulations and experiments demonstrate the capabilities and versatility of the
proposed method, while achieving accurate and continuous estimates for the
state of such systems, resulting in average end-effector errors of 3.3 mm and
5.02{\deg} depending on the sensor setup. It is further shown, that the
approach offers fast computation times of below 10 ms, enabling its utilization
in quasi-static real-time scenarios with average update rates of 100-200 Hz. An
open-source C++ implementation of the proposed state estimation method is made
publicly available to the community.

reach initially unassigned goals in a limited time. Classical planning-based
methods suffer from expensive computation overhead at each step and offer
limited expressiveness for complex cooperation strategies. In contrast,
reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a popular approach for
addressing this issue. However, RL struggles with low data efficiency and
cooperation when directly exploring (nearly) optimal policies in a large
exploration space, especially with an increased number of agents(e.g., 10+
agents) or in complex environments (e.g., 3-D simulators). In this paper, we
propose the Multi-Agent Scalable Graph-based Planner (MASP), a goal-conditioned
hierarchical planner for navigation tasks with a substantial number of agents
in the decentralized setting. MASP employs a hierarchical framework to reduce
space complexity by decomposing a large exploration space into multiple
goal-conditioned subspaces, where a high-level policy assigns agents goals, and
a low-level policy navigates agents toward designated goals. For agent
cooperation and the adaptation to varying team sizes, we model agents and goals
as graphs to better capture their relationship. The high-level policy, the Goal
Matcher, leverages a graph-based Self-Encoder and Cross-Encoder to optimize
goal assignment by updating the agent and the goal graphs. The low-level
policy, the Coordinated Action Executor, introduces the Group Information
Fusion to facilitate group division and extract agent relationships across
groups, enhancing training efficiency for agent cooperation. The results
demonstrate that MASP outperforms RL and planning-based baselines in task
efficiency.

                                        <span>  Cloud Robotics is helping to create a new generation of robots that leverage
the nearly unlimited resources of large data centers (i.e., the cloud),
overcoming the limitations imposed by on-board resources. Different processing
power, capabilities, resource sizes, energy consumption, and so forth, make
scheduling and task allocation critical components. The basic idea of task
allocation and scheduling is to optimize performance by minimizing completion
time, energy consumption, delays between two consecutive tasks, along with
others, and maximizing resource utilization, number of completed tasks in a
given time interval, and suchlike. In the past, several works have addressed
various aspects of task allocation and scheduling. In this paper, we provide a
comprehensive overview of task allocation and scheduling strategies and related
metrics suitable for robotic network cloud systems. We discuss the issues
related to allocation and scheduling methods and the limitations that need to
be overcome. The literature review is organized according to three different
viewpoints: Architectures and Applications, Methods and Parameters. In
addition, the limitations of each method are highlighted for future research.

enabling seamless communication and cooperation between humans and robotic
agents by teaching robots to comprehend and execute instructions conveyed in
natural language. This interdisciplinary area integrates scene understanding,
language processing, and policy learning to bridge the gap between human
instructions and robotic actions. In this comprehensive survey, we
systematically explore recent advancements in language-conditioned robotic
manipulation. We categorize existing methods into language-conditioned reward
shaping, language-conditioned policy learning, neuro-symbolic artificial
intelligence, and the utilization of foundational models (FMs) such as large
language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we
analyze state-of-the-art techniques concerning semantic information extraction,
environment and evaluation, auxiliary tasks, and task representation
strategies. By conducting a comparative analysis, we highlight the strengths
and limitations of current approaches in bridging language instructions with
robot actions. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future research
directions, focusing on potentially enhancing generalization capabilities and
addressing safety issues in language-conditioned robot manipulators. The GitHub

for reinforcement learning research and education. BricksRL facilitates the
creation, design, and training of custom LEGO robots in the real world by
interfacing them with the TorchRL library for reinforcement learning agents.
The integration of TorchRL with the LEGO hubs, via Bluetooth bidirectional
communication, enables state-of-the-art reinforcement learning training on GPUs
for a wide variety of LEGO builds. This offers a flexible and cost-efficient
approach for scaling and also provides a robust infrastructure for
robot-environment-algorithm communication. We present various experiments
across tasks and robot configurations, providing built plans and training
results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inexpensive LEGO robots can be
trained end-to-end in the real world to achieve simple tasks, with training
times typically under 120 minutes on a normal laptop. Moreover, we show how
users can extend the capabilities, exemplified by the successful integration of
non-LEGO sensors. By enhancing accessibility to both robotics and reinforcement
learning, BricksRL establishes a strong foundation for democratized robotic
learning in research and educational settings.

                                        <span>  The realization of universal robots is an ultimate goal of researchers.
However, a key hurdle in achieving this goal lies in the robots' ability to
manipulate objects in their unstructured surrounding environments according to
different tasks. The learning-based approach is considered an effective way to
address generalization. The impressive performance of foundation models in the
fields of computer vision and natural language suggests the potential of
embedding foundation models into manipulation tasks as a viable path toward
achieving general manipulation capability. However, we believe achieving
general manipulation capability requires an overarching framework akin to auto
driving. This framework should encompass multiple functional modules, with
different foundation models assuming distinct roles in facilitating general
manipulation capability. This survey focuses on the contributions of foundation
models to robot learning for manipulation. We propose a comprehensive framework
and detail how foundation models can address challenges in each module of the
framework. What's more, we examine current approaches, outline challenges,
suggest future research directions, and identify potential risks associated
with integrating foundation models into this domain.

condition for reduced bounded motion polynomials to admit factorizations into
monic linear factors, and we give an algorithm to compute them. We can use
those linear factors to construct mechanisms because the factorization
corresponds to the decomposition of the rational motion into simple rotations
or translations. Bounded motion polynomials always admit a factorization into
linear factors after multiplying with a suitable real or quaternion polynomial.
Our criterion for factorizability allows us to improve on earlier algorithms to
compute a suitable real or quaternion polynomial co-factor.

function (CBF) based constraints have been used to design safety-critical
controllers. However, ensuring the existence of a solution at all times to the
QP subject to multiple CBF constraints (hereby called compatibility) is
non-trivial. We quantify the feasible control input space defined by multiple
CBFs at a state in terms of its volume. We then introduce a novel feasible
space (FS) CBF that prevents this volume from going to zero. FS-CBF is shown to
be a sufficient condition for the compatibility of multiple CBFs. For
high-dimensional systems though, finding a valid FS-CBF may be difficult due to
the limitations of existing computational hardware or theoretical approaches.
In such cases, we show empirically that imposing the feasible space volume as a
candidate FS-CBF not only enhances feasibility but also exhibits reduced
sensitivity to changes in the user-chosen parameters such as gains of the
nominal controller. Finally, paired with a global planner, we evaluate our
controller for navigation among other dynamically moving agents in the AWS
Hospital gazebo environment. The proposed controller is demonstrated to
outperform the standard CBF-QP controller in maintaining feasibility.

                                        <span>  Autonomous racing is a critical research area for autonomous driving,
presenting significant challenges in vehicle dynamics modeling, such as
balancing model precision and computational efficiency at high speeds
(>280km/h), where minor errors in modeling have severe consequences. Existing
physics-based models for vehicle dynamics require elaborate testing setups and
tuning, which are hard to implement, time-intensive, and cost-prohibitive.
Conversely, purely data-driven approaches do not generalize well and cannot
adequately ensure physical constraints on predictions. This paper introduces
Deep Dynamics, a physics-constrained neural network (PCNN) for vehicle dynamics
modeling of an autonomous racecar. It combines physics coefficient estimation
and dynamical equations to accurately predict vehicle states at high speeds and
includes a unique Physics Guard layer to ensure internal coefficient estimates
remain within their nominal physical ranges. Open-loop and closed-loop
performance assessments, using a physics-based simulator and full-scale
autonomous Indy racecar data, highlight Deep Dynamics as a promising approach
for modeling racecar vehicle dynamics.

                                        <span>  As the dimension of a system increases, traditional methods for control and
differential games rapidly become intractable, making the design of safe
autonomous agents challenging in complex or team settings. Deep-learning
approaches avoid discretization and yield numerous successes in robotics and
autonomy, but at a higher dimensional limit, accuracy falls as sampling becomes
less efficient. We propose using rapidly generated linear solutions to the
partial differential equation (PDE) arising in the problem to accelerate and
improve learned value functions for guidance in high-dimensional, nonlinear
problems. We define two programs that combine supervision of the linear
solution with a standard PDE loss. We demonstrate that these programs offer
improvements in speed and accuracy in both a 50-D differential game problem and
a 10-D quadrotor control problem.

safety constraints. Designing such filters as functions of visual observations
in uncertain and complex environments is challenging. Several deep
learning-based approaches to tackle this challenge have been proposed recently.
However, formally verifying that the learned filters satisfy critical
properties that enable them to guarantee the safety of the system is currently
beyond reach. Instead, in this work, motivated by the success of ensemble
methods in reinforcement learning, we empirically investigate the efficacy of
ensembles in enhancing the accuracy and the out-of-distribution generalization
of such filters, as a step towards more reliable ones. We experiment with
diverse pre-trained vision representation models as filter backbones, training
approaches, and output aggregation techniques. We compare the performance of
ensembles with different configurations against each other, their individual
member models, and large single-model baselines in distinguishing between safe
and unsafe states and controls in the DeepAccident dataset. Our results show
that diverse ensembles have better state and control classification accuracies
compared to individual models.

                                        <span>  In many security applications of cyber-physical systems, a system designer
must guarantee that critical missions are satisfied against attacks in the
sensors and actuators of the CPS. Traditional security design of CPSs often
assume that attackers have complete knowledge of the system. In this article,
we introduce a class of deception techniques and study how to leverage
asymmetric information created by deception to strengthen CPS security.
Consider an adversarial interaction between a CPS defender and an attacker, who
can perform sensor jamming attacks. To mitigate such attacks, the defender
introduces asymmetrical information by deploying a "hidden sensor," whose
presence is initially undisclosed but can be revealed if queried. We introduce
hypergames on graphs to model this game with asymmetric information. Building
on the solution concept called subjective rationalizable strategies in
hypergames, we identify two stages in the game: An initial game stage where the
defender commits to a strategy perceived rationalizable by the attacker until
he deviates from the equilibrium in the attacker's perceptual game; Upon the
deviation, a delay-attack game stage starts where the defender plays against
the attacker, who has a bounded delay in attacking the sensor being revealed.
Based on backward induction, we develop an algorithm that determines, for any
given state, if the defender can benefit from hiding a sensor and revealing it
later. If the answer is affirmative, the algorithm outputs a sensor revealing
strategy to determine when to reveal the sensor during dynamic interactions. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our deceptive strategies through two case
studies related to CPS security applications.

                                        <span>  Transfer learning is an umbrella term for machine learning approaches that
leverage knowledge gained from solving one problem (the source domain) to
improve speed, efficiency, and data requirements in solving a different but
related problem (the target domain). The performance of the transferred model
in the target domain is typically measured via some notion of loss function in
the target domain. This paper focuses on effectively transferring control logic
from a source control system to a target control system while providing
approximately similar behavioral guarantees in both domains. However, in the
absence of a complete characterization of behavioral specifications, this
problem cannot be captured in terms of loss functions. To overcome this
challenge, we use (approximate) simulation relations to characterize
observational equivalence between the behaviors of two systems.
  Simulation relations ensure that the outputs of both systems, equipped with
their corresponding controllers, remain close to each other over time, and
their closeness can be quantified {\it a priori}. By parameterizing simulation
relations with neural networks, we introduce the notion of \emph{neural
simulation relations}, which provides a data-driven approach to transfer any
synthesized controller, regardless of the specification of interest, along with
its proof of correctness. Compared with prior approaches, our method eliminates
the need for a closed-loop mathematical model and specific requirements for
both the source and target systems. We also introduce validity conditions that,
when satisfied, guarantee the closeness of the outputs of two systems equipped
with their corresponding controllers, thus eliminating the need for post-facto
verification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case
studies involving a vehicle and a double inverted pendulum.

controller can be caused by several factors related to the communication link
between them. Under undesirable conditions, high delay values can produce
oscillations in the wind power plant that can affect the rest of the power
system. In this work, we present a new robust methodology for wind turbines to
estimate the value of the communication control delay using PMU data. Several
scenarios are considered where external faults are simulated and the
performance of the algorithm is evaluated based on dynamic state estimation of
the mathematical model of the wind turbine. In this paper, we have shown that
the characterization of the delay can be performed offering the transmission
system operator an online tool to identify the most suited communication delay

                                        <span>  This paper proposes a slot-based energy storage approach for decision-making
in the context of an Off-Grid telecommunication operator. We consider network
systems powered by solar panels, where harvest energy is stored in a battery
that can also be sold when fully charged. To reflect real-world conditions, we
account for non-stationary energy arrivals and service demands that depend on
the time of day, as well as the failure states of PV panel. The network
operator we model faces two conflicting objectives: maintaining the operation
of its infrastructure and selling (or supplying to other networks) surplus
energy from fully charged batteries. To address these challenges, we developed
a slot-based Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that incorporates positive
rewards for energy sales, as well as penalties for energy loss and battery
depletion. This slot-based MDP follows a specific structure we have previously
proven to be efficient in terms of computational performance and accuracy. From
this model, we derive the optimal policy that balances these conflicting
objectives and maximizes the average reward function. Additionally, we present
results comparing different cities and months, which the operator can consider
when deploying its infrastructure to maximize rewards based on
location-specific energy availability and seasonal variations.

                                        <span>  We study how to synthesize a robust and safe policy for autonomous systems
under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks in adversarial settings against unknown
dynamic agents. To ensure the worst-case STL satisfaction, we propose STLGame,
a framework that models the multi-agent system as a two-player zero-sum game,
where the ego agents try to maximize the STL satisfaction and other agents
minimize it. STLGame aims to find a Nash equilibrium policy profile, which is
the best case in terms of robustness against unseen opponent policies, by using
the fictitious self-play (FSP) framework. FSP iteratively converges to a Nash
profile, even in games set in continuous state-action spaces. We propose a
gradient-based method with differentiable STL formulas, which is crucial in
continuous settings to approximate the best responses at each iteration of FSP.
We show this key aspect experimentally by comparing with reinforcement
learning-based methods to find the best response. Experiments on two standard
dynamical system benchmarks, Ackermann steering vehicles and autonomous drones,
demonstrate that our converged policy is almost unexploitable and robust to
various unseen opponents' policies. All code and additional experimental
results can be found on our project website:

services through network slicing, reduced latency, and support for many IoT
devices in a specific area, all under the owner's full control. Higher security
and privacy to protect sensitive data is the most significant advantage of
private networks, in e.g., smart hospitals. For long-term sustainability and
cost-effectiveness of private 5G networks, analyzing and understanding the
energy consumption variation holds a greater significance in reaching toward
green private network architecture for 6G. This paper addresses this research
gap by providing energy profiling of network components using an experimental
laboratory setup that mimics real private 5G networks under various network

rather than sinusoids. Static nonlinearities map square waves to square waves,
and their behavior is characterized by their response to square waves of
varying amplitude - their amplitude response. The output of an LTI system to a
square wave input is approximated by a square wave, to give an analogue of the
describing function. The classical describing function method for predicting
oscillations in feedback interconnections is generalized to this square wave
setting, and gives accurate predictions when oscillations are approximately
square.

no matter the controller in question. Previous work has proposed a simple and
stealthy false-data injection attack for deactivating such safety filters. This
attack injects false sensor measurements to bias state estimates toward the
interior of a safety region, making the safety filter accept unsafe control
actions. The attack does, however, require the adversary to know the dynamics
of the system, the safety region used in the safety filter, and the observer
gain. In this work we relax these requirements and show how a similar
data-injection attack can be performed when the adversary only observes the
input and output of the observer that is used by the safety filter, without any
a priori knowledge about the system dynamics, safety region, or observer gain.
In particular, the adversary uses the observed data to identify a state-space
model that describes the observer dynamics, and then approximates a safety
region in the identified embedding. We exemplify the data-driven attack on an
inverted pendulum, where we show how the attack can make the system leave a
safe set, even when a safety filter is supposed to stop this from happening.

                                        <span>  As large-scale distributed energy resources are integrated into the active
distribution networks (ADNs), effective energy management in ADNs becomes
increasingly prominent compared to traditional distribution networks. Although
advanced reinforcement learning (RL) methods, which alleviate the burden of
complicated modelling and optimization, have greatly improved the efficiency of
energy management in ADNs, safety becomes a critical concern for RL
applications in real-world problems. Since the design and adjustment of penalty
functions, which correspond to operational safety constraints, requires
extensive domain knowledge in RL and power system operation, the emerging ADN
operators call for a more flexible and customized approach to address the
penalty functions so that the operational safety and efficiency can be further
enhanced. Empowered with strong comprehension, reasoning, and in-context
learning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide a promising way to
assist safe RL for energy management in ADNs. In this paper, we introduce the
LLM to comprehend operational safety requirements in ADNs and generate
corresponding penalty functions. In addition, we propose an RL2 mechanism to
refine the generated functions iteratively and adaptively through multi-round
dialogues, in which the LLM agent adjusts the functions' pattern and parameters
based on training and test performance of the downstream RL agent. The proposed
method significantly reduces the intervention of the ADN operators.
Comprehensive test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

                                        <span>  This paper introduces a novel approach to quantify the uncertainties in fault
diagnosis of motor drives using Bayesian neural networks (BNN). Conventional
data-driven approaches used for fault diagnosis often rely on point-estimate
neural networks, which merely provide deterministic outputs and fail to capture
the uncertainty associated with the inference process. In contrast, BNNs offer
a principled framework to model uncertainty by treating network weights as
probability distributions rather than fixed values. It offers several
advantages: (a) improved robustness to noisy data, (b) enhanced
interpretability of model predictions, and (c) the ability to quantify
uncertainty in the decision-making processes. To test the robustness of the
proposed BNN, it has been tested under a conservative dataset of gear fault
data from an experimental prototype of three fault types at first, and is then
incrementally trained on new fault classes and datasets to explore its
uncertainty quantification features and model interpretability under noisy data
and unseen fault scenarios.

                                        <span>  Given the spatial heterogeneity of land use patterns in most cities,
large-scale UAM will likely be deployed in specific areas, e.g., inter-transfer
traffic between suburbs and city centers. However, large-scale UAM operations
connecting multiple origin-destination pairs raise concerns about air traffic
safety and efficiency with respect to conflict movements, particularly at large
conflict points similar to roadway junctions. In this work, we propose an
operational framework that integrates route guidance and collision avoidance to
achieve an elegant trade-off between air traffic safety and efficiency. The
route guidance mechanism aims to optimize aircraft distribution across both
spatial and temporal dimensions by regulating their paths (composed of
waypoints). Given the optimized paths, the collision avoidance module aims to
generate collision-free aircraft trajectories between waypoints in 3D space. To
enable large-scale operations, we develop a fast approximation method to solve
the optimal path planning problem and employ the velocity obstacle model for
collision avoidance. The proposed route guidance strategy significantly reduces
the computational requirements for collision avoidance. As far as we know, this
work is one of the first to combine route guidance and collision avoidance for
UAM. The results indicate that the framework can enable efficient and flexible
UAM operations, such as air traffic assignment, congestion prevention, and
dynamic airspace clearance. Compared to the management scheme based on air
corridors, the proposed framework has considerable improvements in
computational efficiency (433%), average travel speed (70.2%), and trip
completion rate (130%). The proposed framework has demonstrated great potential
for real-time traffic simulation and management in large-scale UAM systems.

                                        <span>  Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is often combined with feedback
linearization (FBL) for nonlinear systems that have the nonlinearity additive
to the input. Conventional approaches estimate and cancel the nonlinearity
based on the first principle or data-driven methods such as Gaussian Processes
(GPs). However, the former needs an elaborate modeling process, and the latter
provides a fixed learned model, which may be suffering when the model dynamics
are changing. In this letter, we take a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using a
real-time-updated dataset to approximate the unknown nonlinearity while the
controller is running. Spectrally normalizing the weights in each time-step, we
stably incorporate the DNN prediction to an LQR controller and compensate for
the nonlinear term. Leveraging the property of the bounded Lipschitz constant
of the DNN, we provide theoretical analysis and locally exponential stability
of the proposed controller. Simulation results show that our controller
significantly outperforms Baseline controllers in trajectory tracking cases.

                                        <span>  Compared to traditional electrodynamic loudspeakers, the parametric array
loudspeaker (PAL) offers exceptional directivity for audio applications but
suffers from significant nonlinear distortions due to its inherent intricate
demodulation process. The Volterra filter-based approaches have been widely
used to reduce these distortions, but the effectiveness is limited by its
inverse filter's capability. Specifically, its pth-order inverse filter can
only compensate for nonlinearities up to the pth order, while the higher-order
nonlinearities it introduces continue to generate lower-order harmonics. In
contrast, this paper introduces the modern deep learning methods for the first
time to address nonlinear identification and compensation for PAL systems.
Specifically, a feedforward variant of the WaveNet neural network, recognized
for its success in audio nonlinear system modeling, is utilized to identify and
compensate for distortions in a double sideband amplitude modulation-based PAL
system. Experimental measurements from 250 Hz to 8 kHz demonstrate that our
proposed approach significantly reduces both total harmonic distortion and
intermodulation distortion of audio sound generated by PALs, achieving average
reductions to 4.55% and 2.47%, respectively. This performance is notably
superior to results obtained using the current state-of-the-art Volterra
filter-based methods. Our work opens new possibilities for improving the sound
reproduction performance of PALs.

challenging for unknown systems due to the difficulties in accurately modelling
dynamics and handling computational demands, particularly in high-dimensional
settings. This work develops a theoretically certifiable framework that
integrates a modified Koopman operator approach with model-based reinforcement
learning to address these challenges. By relaxing the requirements on
observable functions, our method incorporates nonlinear terms involving both

control for high-dimensional dynamical systems, up to 9-dimensional. The
learned value function and control laws are proven to converge to those of the
true system at each iteration. Additionally, the accumulated cost of the
learned control closely approximates that of the true system, with errors
ranging from $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-3}$.

                                        <span>  In recent years, frequent extreme events have put forward higher requirements
for improving the resilience of distribution networks (DNs). Introducing energy
storage integrated with soft open point (E-SOP) is one of the effective ways to
improve resilience. However, the widespread application of E-SOP is limited by
its high investment cost. Based on this, we propose a cost allocation framework
and optimal planning method of E-SOP in resilient DN. Firstly, a cost
allocation mechanism for E-SOP based on resilience insurance service is
designed; the probability of power users purchasing resilience insurance
service is determined based on the expected utility theory. Then, a four-layer
stochastic distributionally robust optimization (SDRO) model is developed for
E-SOP planning and insurance pricing strategy, where the uncertainty in the
intensity of contingent extreme events is addressed by a stochastic
optimization approach, while the uncertainty in the occurrence of outages and
resilience insurance purchases resulting from a specific extreme event is
addressed via a distributionally robust optimization approach. Finally, The
effectiveness of the proposed model is verified on the modified IEEE 33-bus DN.

                                        <span>  Intelligent streetlight systems divide the streetlight network into multiple
sectors, activating only the streetlights in the corresponding sectors when
traffic elements pass by, rather than all streetlights, effectively reducing
energy waste. This strategy requires streetlights to understand their neighbor
relationships to illuminate only the streetlights in their respective sectors.
However, manually configuring the neighbor relationships for a large number of
streetlights in complex large-scale road streetlight networks is cumbersome and
prone to errors. Due to the crisscrossing nature of roads, it is also difficult
to determine the neighbor relationships using GPS or communication positioning.
In response to these issues, this article proposes a systematic approach to
model the streetlight network as a social network and construct a neighbor
relationship probabilistic graph using IoT event records of streetlights
detecting traffic elements. Based on this, a multi-objective genetic algorithm
based probabilistic graph clustering method is designed to discover the
neighbor relationships of streetlights. Considering the characteristic that
pedestrians and vehicles usually move at a constant speed on a section of a
road, speed consistency is introduced as an optimization objective, which,
together with traditional similarity measures, forms a multi-objective
function, enhancing the accuracy of neighbor relationship discovery. Extensive
experiments on simulation datasets were conducted, comparing the proposed
algorithm with other probabilistic graph clustering algorithms. The results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can more accurately identify the
neighbor relationships of streetlights compared to other algorithms,
effectively achieving adaptive streetlight control for traffic elements.

                                        <span>  Dynamic game theory is an increasingly popular tool for modeling multi-agent,
e.g. human-robot, interactions. Game-theoretic models presume that each agent
wishes to minimize a private cost function that depends on others' actions.
These games typically evolve over a fixed time horizon, which specifies the
degree to which all agents care about the distant future. In practical
settings, however, decision-makers may vary in their degree of
short-sightedness. We conjecture that quantifying and estimating each agent's
short-sightedness from online data will enable safer and more efficient
interactions with other agents. To this end, we frame this inference problem as
an inverse dynamic game. We consider a specific parametrization of each agent's
objective function that smoothly interpolates myopic and farsighted planning.
Games of this form are readily transformed into parametric mixed
complementarity problems; we exploit the directional differentiability of
solutions to these problems with respect to their hidden parameters in order to
solve for agents' short-sightedness. We conduct several experiments simulating
human behavior at a real-world crosswalk. The results of these experiments
clearly demonstrate that by explicitly inferring agents' short-sightedness, we
can recover more accurate game-theoretic models, which ultimately allow us to
make better predictions of agents' behavior. Specifically, our results show up
to a 30% more accurate prediction of myopic behavior compared to the baseline.

in a tracking problem. The controller is based on a Gaussian Process (GP) whose
realizations satisfy a system of linear ordinary differential equations with
constant coefficients. Control inputs for tracking are determined by
conditioning the prior GP on the setpoints, i.e. control as inference. The
resulting Model Predictive Control scheme incorporates pointwise soft
constraints by introducing virtual setpoints to the posterior Gaussian process.
We show theoretically that our controller satisfies asymptotical stability for
the optimal control problem by leveraging general results from Bayesian
inference and demonstrate this result in a numerical example.

optimization using system model-based predictions over a finite time horizon.
However, the computational cost MPC requires can be prohibitive in
resource-constrained computer systems. This paper presents a fuzzy controller
synthesis framework guided by MPC. In the proposed framework, training data is
obtained from MPC closed-loop simulations and is used to optimize a low
computational complexity controller to emulate the response of MPC. In
particular, autoregressive moving average (ARMA) controllers are trained using
data obtained from MPC closed-loop simulations, such that each ARMA controller
emulates the response of the MPC controller under particular desired
conditions. Using a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system, the responses of all the
trained ARMA controllers are then weighted depending on the measured system
conditions, resulting in the Fuzzy-Autoregressive Moving Average (F-ARMA)
controller. The effectiveness of the trained F-ARMA controllers is illustrated

                                        <span>  Upper-limb amputees face tremendous difficulty in operating dexterous powered
prostheses. Previous work has shown that aspects of prosthetic hand, wrist, or
elbow control can be improved through "intelligent" control, by combining
movement-based or gaze-based intent estimation with low-level robotic autonomy.
However, no such solutions exist for whole-arm control. Moreover, hardware
platforms for advanced prosthetic control are expensive, and existing
simulation platforms are not well-designed for integration with robotics
software frameworks. We present the Prosthetic Arm Control Testbed (ProACT), a
platform for evaluating intelligent control methods for prosthetic arms in an
immersive (Augmented Reality) simulation setting. We demonstrate the use of
ProACT through preliminary studies, with non-amputee participants performing an
adapted Box-and-Blocks task with and without intent estimation. We further
discuss how our observations may inform the design of prosthesis control
methods, as well as the design of future studies using the platform. To the
best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first study of semi-autonomous
control for complex whole-arm prostheses, the first study including sequential
task modeling in the context of wearable prosthetic arms, and the first testbed
of its kind. Towards the goal of supporting future research in intelligent
prosthetics, the system is built upon on existing open-source frameworks for
robotics, and is available at https://arm.stanford.edu/proact.

                                        <span>  We present a deep neural network-enabled method to accelerate near-field (NF)
antenna measurement. We develop a Near-field Super-resolution Network (NFS-Net)
to reconstruct significantly undersampled near-field data as high-resolution
data, which considerably reduces the number of sampling points required for NF
measurement and thus improves measurement efficiency. The high-resolution
near-field data reconstructed by the network is further processed by a
near-field-to-far-field (NF2FF) transformation to obtain far-field antenna
radiation patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that the NFS-Net exhibits both
accuracy and generalizability in restoring high-resolution near-field data from
low-resolution input. The NF measurement workflow that combines the NFS-Net and
the NF2FF algorithm enables accurate radiation pattern characterization with
only 11% of the Nyquist rate samples. Though the experiments in this study are
conducted on a planar setup with a uniform grid, the proposed method can serve
as a universal strategy to accelerate measurements under different setups and
conditions.

                                        <span>  Autonomous systems have witnessed a rapid increase in their capabilities, but
it remains a challenge for them to perform tasks both effectively and safely.
The fact that performance and safety can sometimes be competing objectives
renders the cooptimization between them difficult. One school of thought is to
treat this cooptimization as a constrained optimal control problem with a
performance-oriented objective function and safety as a constraint. However,
solving this constrained optimal control problem for general nonlinear systems
remains challenging. In this work, we use the general framework of constrained
optimal control, but given the safety state constraint, we convert it into an
equivalent control constraint, resulting in a state and time-dependent
control-constrained optimal control problem. This equivalent optimal control
problem can readily be solved using the dynamic programming principle. We show
the corresponding value function is a viscosity solution of a certain
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Partial Differential Equation (HJB-PDE). Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with a two-dimensional case
study, and the experiment shows that the controller synthesized using our
method consistently outperforms the baselines, both in safety and performance.

                                        <span>  The reliability, lower computational complexity, and ease of implementation
of control observers make them one of the most promising methods for the state
estimation of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) in commercial applications. To pave their
way, this study performs a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of four main
categories of control observer-based methods in different practical scenarios
considering estimation accuracy, computational time convergence speed,
stability, and robustness against measurement uncertainties. Observers are
designed using a second-order equivalent circuit model whose observability
against different scenarios is rigorously investigated to verify the
feasibility of the proposed analysis. Established techniques then are validated
against driving datasets and their comparative usefulness is evaluated using an
experimental setup. The analysis also evaluates the adaptability of different
techniques to electric vehicle field data. The results indicate better
accuracy, stability, robustness, and faster convergence for the PI and PID,
while the estimations of the Luenberger observers find it hard to converge
against highly dynamic loadfiles. Moreover, this study also discusses the
sensitivity of observer-based techniques to battery ohmic polarization and
voltage-related measurement uncertainties. The most remarkable contribution of
the proposed study lies in providing guidance for researchers when choosing the
control observers for online state estimation of LIBs.

                                        <span>  We investigate decentralized state estimation for a discrete event system in
a setting where the information received at a coordinator may be corrupted or
tampered by a malicious attacker. Specifically, a system is observed by a set
of (local) observation sites (OSs) which occasionally send their recorded
sequences of observations to the coordinator that is in charge of estimating
the system state. The malfunctions and attacks, referred to as errors in this
paper, include symbol deletions, insertions and replacements, each of which
bears a positive cost. Two types of errors, global errors and local errors, are
proposed to describe the impact of errors on decentralized information
processing. Global errors occur when all OSs record the same error, while local
errors occur when different OSs record different errors. Distinguishing these
types of errors is important for a proper design of decentralized information
processing (so as to be more resilient and better equipped to handle attacks
and failures). For each type of error, we propose two methods to efficiently
perform state estimation: one based on appropriately modifying the original
system and the other based on inferring the matching behavior of the original
system. For each method, we adopt an estimation-by-release methodology to
design an algorithm for constructing a corresponding synchronizer for state
estimation.

identifying an LTI system from a finite set of possible systems using
trajectory data. To this end, we use the maximum likelihood estimator to
identify the true system and provide an upper bound for its sample complexity.
Crucially, the derived bound does not rely on a potentially restrictive
stability assumption. Additionally, we leverage tools from information theory
to provide a lower bound to the sample complexity that holds independently of
the used estimator. The derived sample complexity bounds are analyzed
analytically and numerically.

nonlinear semi-strict-feedback multi-agent systems (MASs) with unknown states
and subject to disturbances. We begin by employing radial basis function neural
networks combined with the backstepping method to approximate the unknown
nonlinear dynamics of the MASs, which facilitates the development of state and
disturbance observers for estimation. We then propose three adaptive
event-triggered control strategies: fixed-threshold, relative-threshold, and
switch-threshold, whose controllers and triggering conditions are defined
acocrdingly. By applying Lyapunov stability theory, we rigorously prove that
all follower agents' outputs consistently track the reference of their leader,
and all error signals remain uniformly bounded. Moreover, our control
strategies effectively mitigate the occurrence of Zeno behaviors. To validate
our control framework, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate its
desirable performance in consensus tracking and triggering efficiency.

interacting particles to represent, approximate, and learn the optimal control
law for reinforcement learning (RL). The primary contribution is that
convergence rates are greatly accelerated by the interactions between
particles. Theory focuses on the linear quadratic stochastic optimal control
problem for which a complete and novel theory is presented. Apart from the new
algorithm, sample complexity bounds are obtained, and it is shown that the mean
square error scales as $1/N$ where $N$ is the number of particles. The
theoretical results and algorithms are illustrated with numerical experiments
and comparisons with other recent approaches, where the faster convergence of
the proposed algorithm is numerically demonstrated.

concern as AM adoption continues to grow. AM is now being used for parts in the
aerospace, transportation, and medical domains. Threat vectors which allow for
part compromise are particularly concerning, as any failure in these domains
would have life-threatening consequences. A major challenge to investigation of
AM part-compromises comes from the difficulty in evaluating and benchmarking
both identified threat vectors as well as methods for detecting adversarial
actions. In this work, we introduce a generalized platform for systematic
analysis of attacks against and defenses for 3D printers. Our "OFFRAMPS"
platform is based on the open-source 3D printer control board "RAMPS." OFFRAMPS
allows analysis, recording, and modification of all control signals and I/O for
a 3D printer. We show the efficacy of OFFRAMPS by presenting a series of case
studies based on several Trojans, including ones identified in the literature,
and show that OFFRAMPS can both emulate and detect these attacks, i.e., it can
both change and detect arbitrary changes to the g-code print commands.

                                        <span>  As the dimension of a system increases, traditional methods for control and
differential games rapidly become intractable, making the design of safe
autonomous agents challenging in complex or team settings. Deep-learning
approaches avoid discretization and yield numerous successes in robotics and
autonomy, but at a higher dimensional limit, accuracy falls as sampling becomes
less efficient. We propose using rapidly generated linear solutions to the
partial differential equation (PDE) arising in the problem to accelerate and
improve learned value functions for guidance in high-dimensional, nonlinear
problems. We define two programs that combine supervision of the linear
solution with a standard PDE loss. We demonstrate that these programs offer
improvements in speed and accuracy in both a 50-D differential game problem and
a 10-D quadrotor control problem.

                                        <span>  Langevin algorithms are popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian
learning, particularly when the aim is to sample from the posterior
distribution of a parametric model, given the input data and the prior
distribution over the model parameters. Their stochastic versions such as
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) allow iterative learning based on
randomly sampled mini-batches of large datasets and are scalable to large
datasets. However, when data is decentralized across a network of agents
subject to communication and privacy constraints, standard SGLD algorithms
cannot be applied. Instead, we employ decentralized SGLD (DE-SGLD) algorithms,
where Bayesian learning is performed collaboratively by a network of agents
without sharing individual data. Nonetheless, existing DE-SGLD algorithms
induce a bias at every agent that can negatively impact performance; this bias
persists even when using full batches and is attributable to network effects.
Motivated by the EXTRA algorithm and its generalizations for decentralized
optimization, we propose the generalized EXTRA stochastic gradient Langevin
dynamics, which eliminates this bias in the full-batch setting. Moreover, we
show that, in the mini-batch setting, our algorithm provides performance bounds
that significantly improve upon those of standard DE-SGLD algorithms in the
literature. Our numerical results also demonstrate the efficiency of the
proposed approach.

challenges in machine learning. Traditional classifiers often struggle to
accurately capture the characteristics of the minority class, resulting in
biased models with subpar predictive performance. In this paper, we introduce a
novel approach to tackle this issue by leveraging Universum points to support
the minority class within quadratic twin support vector machine models. Unlike
traditional classifiers, our models utilize quadratic surfaces instead of
hyperplanes for binary classification, providing greater flexibility in
modeling complex decision boundaries. By incorporating Universum points, our
approach enhances classification accuracy and generalization performance on
imbalanced datasets. We generated four artificial datasets to demonstrate the
flexibility of the proposed methods. Additionally, we validated the
effectiveness of our approach through empirical evaluations on benchmark
datasets, showing superior performance compared to conventional classifiers and
existing methods for imbalanced classification.

                                        <span>  We study a censored variant of the data-driven newsvendor problem, where the
decision-maker must select an ordering quantity that minimizes expected overage
and underage costs based only on censored sales data, rather than historical
demand realizations. To isolate the impact of demand censoring on this problem,
we adopt a distributionally robust optimization framework, evaluating policies
according to their worst-case regret over an ambiguity set of distributions.
This set is defined by the largest historical order quantity (the observable
boundary of the dataset), and contains all distributions matching the true
demand distribution up to this boundary, while allowing them to be arbitrary
afterwards. We demonstrate a spectrum of achievability under demand censoring
by deriving a natural necessary and sufficient condition under which vanishing
regret is an achievable goal. In regimes in which it is not, we exactly
characterize the information loss due to censoring: an insurmountable lower
bound on the performance of any policy, even when the decision-maker has access
to infinitely many demand samples. We then leverage these sharp
characterizations to propose a natural robust algorithm that adapts to the
historical level of demand censoring. We derive finite-sample guarantees for
this algorithm across all possible censoring regimes, and show its
near-optimality with matching lower bounds (up to polylogarithmic factors). We
moreover demonstrate its robust performance via extensive numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes a slot-based energy storage approach for decision-making
in the context of an Off-Grid telecommunication operator. We consider network
systems powered by solar panels, where harvest energy is stored in a battery
that can also be sold when fully charged. To reflect real-world conditions, we
account for non-stationary energy arrivals and service demands that depend on
the time of day, as well as the failure states of PV panel. The network
operator we model faces two conflicting objectives: maintaining the operation
of its infrastructure and selling (or supplying to other networks) surplus
energy from fully charged batteries. To address these challenges, we developed
a slot-based Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that incorporates positive
rewards for energy sales, as well as penalties for energy loss and battery
depletion. This slot-based MDP follows a specific structure we have previously
proven to be efficient in terms of computational performance and accuracy. From
this model, we derive the optimal policy that balances these conflicting
objectives and maximizes the average reward function. Additionally, we present
results comparing different cities and months, which the operator can consider
when deploying its infrastructure to maximize rewards based on
location-specific energy availability and seasonal variations.

attacker on a search space, which may be a compact subset of Euclidean space or
a network. The defender has several booby traps and chooses where to plant
them. The attacker, aware of the presence of these booby traps but not their
locations, chooses a subset of the space and collects a reward equal to the
measure of the subset. If the attacker does not encounter any booby traps, then
the attacker keeps the reward; otherwise, the attacker gets nothing. The
attacker's objective is to maximize the expected reward, while the defender's
objective is to minimize it. We solve this game in the case that the search
space is a compact subset of Euclidean space, and then turn our attention to
the case where the search space is a network in which the attacker must choose
a connected subset of the network. We solve the game when the network is a
circle or a line. For the case of one booby trap, we solve the game for
2-connected networks, and when the network is a tree we present an upper bound
and a lower bound for the value of the game whose ratio is at most 27/25. We
also present an optimal solution for each player in a few cases where the tree
is a star network.

                                        <span>  In this work, we address three non-convex optimization problems associated
with the training of shallow neural networks (NNs) for exact and approximate
representation, as well as for regression tasks. Through a mean-field approach,
we convexify these problems and, applying a representer theorem, prove the
absence of relaxation gaps. We establish generalization bounds for the
resulting NN solutions, assessing their predictive performance on test datasets
and, analyzing the impact of key hyperparameters on these bounds, propose
optimal choices.
  On the computational side, we examine the discretization of the convexified
problems and derive convergence rates. For low-dimensional datasets, these
discretized problems are efficiently solvable using the simplex method. For
high-dimensional datasets, we propose a sparsification algorithm that, combined
with gradient descent for over-parameterized shallow NNs, yields effective
solutions to the primal problems.

rather than sinusoids. Static nonlinearities map square waves to square waves,
and their behavior is characterized by their response to square waves of
varying amplitude - their amplitude response. The output of an LTI system to a
square wave input is approximated by a square wave, to give an analogue of the

oscillations in feedback interconnections is generalized to this square wave
setting, and gives accurate predictions when oscillations are approximately

                                        <span>  In an optimal control strategy, an important point is to define the cost of
the control. Usually it is added to the control criterion and multiplied by a
small coefficient denoted by $\varepsilon$ which is known as the marginal cost
of the control. The key idea of this paper, is to introduce a smoothing term in
the control cost which aims at reducing the quantity of energy spent and
reducing the oscillations of the control. Then using a so-called asymptotic
control based on the smallness of $\varepsilon$, we construct an exact control
which can be implemented in a close loop. The energy involved in the control
depends mainly on the variation of the control. Therefore it seems natural to
include this quantity (the total variations) in the criterion involved in the
optimal control. This can be done approximately by introducing the $L^1$ norm
of the first order derivative of the control. The control strategy that we
develop in this paper can be applied to such linear models. One important and
new point is that we focus on exact control strategies for a non-differentiable
criterion because of the cost of the control. Following the ideas of Tykhonov
regularization method, it is proved using the so-called asymptotic method based
on the smallness of the marginal cost of the control, that the exact control
suggested is the one which represents the minimum of the marginal cost among
exact controls. Furthermore, and it is the main technical point, it can reduce
the variations of the control with an adequate tuning of the various parameters
of the control loop. We test the method on three examples.

                                        <span>  In human social systems, debates are often seen as a means to resolve
differences of opinion. However, in reality, debates frequently incur
significant communication costs, especially when dealing with stubborn
opponents. Inspired by this phenomenon, this paper examines the impact of
malicious agents on the evolution of normal agents' opinions from the
perspective of opinion evolution cost, and proposes corresponding solutions for
the scenario in which malicious agents hold different opinions in multi-agent
systems(MASs). First, the paper analyzes the negative impact of malicious
agents on the opinion evolution process, revealing the evolutionary cost they
bring, which provides the theoretical foundation for the proposed solution.
Next, based on the process of opinion evolution, a strategy is introduced where
agents dynamically adjust trust values during the opinion evolution process,
gradually isolating malicious agents and achieving this even when malicious
agents are in the majority. Additionally, an evolution rate adjustment
mechanism is introduced, allowing the system to flexibly regulate the evolution
process in complex situations, effectively achieving the trade-off between
opinion evolution rate and cost. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate
that the algorithm can effectively isolate the negative influence of malicious
agents and achieve a balance between opinion evolution costs and convergence
speed.

                                        <span>  With a view on bilevel and PDE-constrained optimisation, we develop iterative
estimates $\widetilde{F'}(x^k)$ of $F'(x^k)$ for compositions $F :=J \circ S$,
where $S$ is the solution mapping of the inner optimisation problem or PDE. The
idea is to form a single-loop method by interweaving updates of the iterate
$x^k$ by an outer optimisation method, with updates of the estimate by single
steps of standard optimisation methods and linear system solvers. When the
inner methods satisfy simple tracking inequalities, the differential estimates
can almost directly be employed in standard convergence proofs for general
forward-backward type methods. We adapt those proofs to a general inexact
setting in normed spaces, that, besides our differential estimates, also covers
mismatched adjoints and unreachable optimality conditions in measure spaces. As
a side product of these efforts, we provide improved convergence results for
nonconvex Primal-Dual Proximal Splitting (PDPS).

                                        <span>  Due to the strong nonlinearity and nonholonomic dynamics, despite that
various general trajectory optimization methods have been presented, few of
them can guarantee efficient compu-tation and physical feasibility for
relatively complicated fixed-wing UAV dynamics. Aiming at this issue, this
paper investigates a differential flatness-based trajectory optimization method
for fixed-wing UAVs (DFTO-FW), which transcribes the trajectory optimization
into a lightweight, unconstrained, gradient-analytical optimization with linear
time complexity in each itera-tion to achieve fast trajectory generation.
Through differential flat characteristics analysis and polynomial
parameterization, the customized trajectory representation is presented, which
implies the equality constraints to avoid the heavy computational burdens of
solving complex dynamics. Through the design of integral performance costs and
deduction of analytical gradients, the original trajectory optimization is
transcribed into an uncon-strained, gradient-analytical optimization with
linear time com-plexity to further improve efficiency. The simulation
experi-ments illustrate the superior efficiency of the DFTO-FW, which takes
sub-second CPU time against other competitors by orders of magnitude to
generate fixed-wing UAV trajectories in ran-domly generated obstacle
environments.

in general hard to solve, i.e., the corresponding decision problem is NP-hard
and the outcome set is intractable. In this paper we explore special cases of
MUCO problems that are actually easy, i.e., solvable in polynomial time. More
precisely, we show that MUCO problems with up to two ordinal objective
functions plus one real-valued objective function are tractable, and that their
complete nondominated set can be computed in polynomial time. For MUCO problems
with one ordinal and a second ordinal or real-valued objective function we
present an even more efficient algorithm that applies a greedy strategy
multiple times.

relying on the Markov property of the underlying process. We demonstrate that
the global iterates of the algorithm converge to a stationary distribution and
analyze its resulting bias and variance relative to the problem's solution. We
provide a first-order expansion of the bias in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Interestingly, this bias decomposes into two distinct
components: one that depends solely on stochastic gradient noise and another on
client heterogeneity. Finally, we introduce a new algorithm based on the
Richardson-Romberg extrapolation technique to mitigate this bias.

differential control problem driven by a nonlinear hemivariational inequality
in a Hilbert space. First, we prove the existence of a mild solution for a

inequality by using the nonsmooth analysis and fixed point technique. Further,
we established sufficient conditions for the approximate controllability of our

Finally, we provide an example to illustrate the efficiency of the developed

                                        <span>  Solar Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC)-based power generation plants leverage
solar irradiation to produce thermal energy, offering a highly compatible
renewable technology due to the alignment between solar irradiation
temperatures and ORC operating requirements. Their superior performance
compared to steam Rankine cycles in small-scale applications makes them
particularly relevant within the smart grid and microgrid contexts. This study
explores the role of ORC in peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading within
renewable-based community microgrids, where consumers become prosumers,
simultaneously producing and consuming energy while engaging in virtual trading
at the distribution system level. Focusing on a microgrid integrating solar ORC
with a storage system to meet consumer demand, the paper highlights the
importance of combining these technologies with storage to enhance
predictability and competitiveness with conventional energy plants, despite
management challenges. A methodology based on operations research techniques is
developed to optimize system performance. Furthermore, the impact of various
technological parameters of the solar ORC on the system's performance is
examined. The study concludes by assessing the value of solar ORC within the
transactive energy trading framework across different configurations and
scenarios. Results demonstrate an average 16\% reduction in operational costs,
showcasing the benefits of implementing a predictable and manageable system in
P2P transactive energy trading.

of employed and unemployed individuals. Lifelong learning is a crucial factor
in securing employment or enhancing one's existing career prospects. To achieve
this objective, this study proposes the implementation of a multi-criteria
decision support system for the evaluation of training courses in accordance
with their capacity to enhance the employability of the students. The
methodology is delineated in four stages. Firstly, a `working life curve' was
defined to provide a quantitative description of an individual's working life.
Secondly, an analysis based on K-medoids clustering defined a control group for
each individual for comparison. Thirdly, the performance of a course according
to each of the four predefined criteria was calculated using a t-test to
determine the mean performance value of those who took the course. Ultimately,
the unweighted TOPSIS method was used to evaluate the efficacy of the various
training courses in relation to the four criteria. This approach effectively
addresses the challenge of using extensive datasets within a system while
facilitating the application of a multi-criteria unweighted TOPSIS method. The
results of the multi-criteria TOPSIS method indicated that training courses
related to the professional fields of administration and management, hostel and
tourism and community and sociocultural services have positive impact on
employability and improving the working conditions of citizens. However,
courses that demonstrate the greatest effectiveness in ranking are the least
demanded by citizens. The results will help policymakers evaluate the
effectiveness of each training course offered by the regional government.

                                        <span>  Optimal control problems for nonsmooth dynamical systems governed by
differential variational inequalities (DVI) are called optimal control problems
with equilibrium constraints (OCPEC). It provides a general formalism for
nonsmooth optimal control. However, solving OCPEC using the direct method
(i.e., first-discretize-then-optimize) is challenging owing to the lack of
correct sensitivity and constraint regularity. This study uses the direct
method to solve OCPEC and overcomes the numerical difficulties from two
aspects: In the discretization step, we propose a class of novel approaches
using gap functions to smooth the DVI, where gap functions are initially
proposed for solving variational inequalities. The generated smoothing
approximations of discretized OCPEC are called gap-constraint-based
reformulations, which have a concise and semismoothly differentiable constraint
system; In the optimization step, we propose an efficient dynamical system
approach to solve the discretized OCPEC, where a sequence of
gap-constraint-based reformulations is solved approximately. This dynamical
system approach involves a semismooth Newton flow and achieves local
exponential convergence under standard assumptions. The benchmark test shows
that the proposed method is computationally tractable and achieves fast local
convergence.

the acceptance by the intended users. This is influenced among other factors by
the interpretability of the solution process. Decision rules that meet this
requirement can be generated using the framework for inherently interpretable
optimization models. In practice, there is often uncertainty about the
parameters of an optimization problem. An established way to deal with this
challenge is the concept of robust optimization. The goal of our work is to
combine both concepts: to create decision trees as surrogates for the
optimization process that are more robust to perturbations and still inherently
interpretable. For this purpose we present suitable models based on different
variants to model uncertainty, and solution methods. Furthermore, the
applicability of heuristic methods to perform this task is evaluated. Both
approaches are compared with the existing framework for inherently
interpretable optimization models.

                                        <span>  Modern wireless communication systems necessitate the development of
cost-effective resource allocation strategies, while ensuring maximal system
performance. While commonly realizable via efficient waterfilling schemes,
ergodic-optimal policies often exhibit instantaneous resource constraint
fluctuations as a result of fading variability, violating prescribed
specifications possibly within unacceptable margins, inducing further
operational challenges and/or costs. On the other extent, short-term-optimal
policies -- commonly based on deterministic waterfilling-- while strictly
maintaining operational specifications, are not only impractical and
computationally demanding, but also suboptimal in a long-term sense. To address
these challenges, we introduce a novel distributionally robust version of a
classical point-to-point interference-free multi-terminal constrained
stochastic resource allocation problem, by leveraging the Conditional
Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a coherent measure of power policy fluctuation risk. We
derive closed-form dual-parameterized expressions for the CVaR-optimal resource
policy, along with corresponding optimal CVaR quantile levels by capitalizing
on (sampling) the underlying fading distribution. We subsequently develop two
dual-domain schemes -- one model-based and one model-free -- to iteratively
determine a globally-optimal resource policy. Our numerical simulations confirm
the remarkable effectiveness of the proposed approach, also revealing an
almost-constant character of the CVaR-optimal policy and at rather minimal
ergodic rate optimality loss.

hierarchical approach embedded with bundling operations to compute multiple and
mutually disjoint Euclidean Steiner trees that avoid clutter and overlapping
with obstacles in the plane, which is significant to model the decentralized

                                        <span>  Coordinated multi-robot motion planning at intersections is key for safe
mobility in roads, factories and warehouses. The rapidly exploring random tree
(RRT) algorithms are popular in multi-robot motion planning. However,
generating the graph configuration space and searching in the composite tensor
configuration space is computationally expensive for large number of sample
points. In this paper, we propose a new evolutionary-based algorithm using a
parametric lattice-based configuration and the discrete-based RRT for
collision-free multi-robot planning at intersections. Our computational
experiments using complex planning intersection scenarios have shown the
feasibility and the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to seven
other related approaches. Our results offer new sampling and representation
mechanisms to render optimization-based approaches for multi-robot navigation.

                                        <span>  Quadratic programs (QPs) arise in various domains such as machine learning,
finance, and control. Recently, learning-enhanced primal-dual hybrid gradient
(PDHG) methods have shown great potential in addressing large-scale linear
programs; however, this approach has not been extended to QPs. In this work, we
focus on unrolling "PDQP", a PDHG algorithm specialized for convex QPs.
Specifically, we propose a neural network model called "PDQP-net" to learn
optimal QP solutions. Theoretically, we demonstrate that a PDQP-net of
polynomial size can align with the PDQP algorithm, returning optimal
primal-dual solution pairs. We propose an unsupervised method that incorporates
KKT conditions into the loss function. Unlike the standard learning-to-optimize
framework that requires optimization solutions generated by solvers, our
unsupervised method adjusts the network weights directly from the evaluation of
the primal-dual gap. This method has two benefits over supervised learning:
first, it helps generate better primal-dual gap since the primal-dual gap is in
the objective function; second, it does not require solvers. We show that
PDQP-net trained in this unsupervised manner can effectively approximate
optimal QP solutions. Extensive numerical experiments confirm our findings,
indicating that using PDQP-net predictions to warm-start PDQP can achieve up to
45% acceleration on QP instances. Moreover, it achieves 14% to 31% acceleration
on out-of-distribution instances.

                                        <span>  We introduce the Rigged Dynamic Mode Decomposition (Rigged DMD) algorithm,
which computes generalized eigenfunction decompositions of Koopman operators.
By considering the evolution of observables, Koopman operators transform
complex nonlinear dynamics into a linear framework suitable for spectral
analysis. While powerful, traditional Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)
techniques often struggle with continuous spectra. Rigged DMD addresses these
challenges with a data-driven methodology that approximates the Koopman
operator's resolvent and its generalized eigenfunctions using snapshot data
from the system's evolution. At its core, Rigged DMD builds wave-packet
approximations for generalized Koopman eigenfunctions and modes by integrating
Measure-Preserving Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition with high-order kernels
for smoothing. This provides a robust decomposition encompassing both discrete
and continuous spectral elements. We derive explicit high-order convergence
theorems for generalized eigenfunctions and spectral measures. Additionally, we
propose a novel framework for constructing rigged Hilbert spaces using
time-delay embedding, significantly extending the algorithm's applicability
(Rigged DMD can be used with any rigging). We provide examples, including
systems with a Lebesgue spectrum, integrable Hamiltonian systems, the Lorenz
system, and a high-Reynolds number lid-driven flow in a two-dimensional square
cavity, demonstrating Rigged DMD's convergence, efficiency, and versatility.
This work paves the way for future research and applications of decompositions
with continuous spectra.

$\mu,\nu\in\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ as the flow of a linear-control neural
ODE, where the control depends only on the time variable and takes values in a
finite-dimensional space. We first show that, under suitable assumptions on
$\mu,\nu$ and on the controlled vector fields governing the neural ODE, the
optimal transport map is contained in the $C^0_c$-closure of the flows
generated by the system. Then, we tackle the problem under the assumption that
only discrete approximations of $\mu_N,\nu_N$ of the original measures
$\mu,\nu$ are available: we formulate approximated optimal control problems,
and we show that their solutions give flows that approximate the original
optimal transport map $T$. In the framework of generative models, the
approximating flow constructed here can be seen as a `Normalizing Flow', which
usually refers to the task of providing invertible transport maps between
probability measures by means of deep neural networks. We propose an iterative
numerical scheme based on the Pontryagin Maximum Principle for the resolution
of the optimal control problem, resulting in a method for the practical
computation of the approximated optimal transport map, and we test it on a
two-dimensional example.

optimization problems on Riemannian manifolds of bounded sectional curvature.
Each step of our method is based on a model that involves the convex hull of
previously collected subgradients, parallelly transported into the current
serious iterate. This approach generalizes the dual form of classical bundle
subproblems in Euclidean space. We prove that, under mild conditions, the
convex bundle method converges to a minimizer. Several numerical examples
implemented using Manopt.jl illustrate the performance of the proposed method
and compare it to the subgradient method, the cyclic proximal point algorithm,
as well as the proximal bundle method.

                                        <span>  We introduce a new class of adaptive non-linear autoregressive (Nlar) models
incorporating the concept of momentum, which dynamically estimate both the
learning rates and momentum as the number of iterations increases. In our
method, the growth of the gradients is controlled using a scaling (clipping)
function, leading to stable convergence. Within this framework, we propose
three distinct estimators for learning rates and provide theoretical proof of
their convergence. We further demonstrate how these estimators underpin the
development of effective Nlar optimizers. The performance of the proposed
estimators and optimizers is rigorously evaluated through extensive experiments
across several datasets and a reinforcement learning environment. The results
highlight two key features of the Nlar optimizers: robust convergence despite
variations in underlying parameters, including large initial learning rates,
and strong adaptability with rapid convergence during the initial epochs.

                                        <span>  Distributed learning and adaptation have received significant interest and
found wide-ranging applications in machine learning and signal processing.
While various approaches, such as shared-memory optimization, multi-task
learning, and consensus-based learning (e.g., federated learning and learning
over graphs), focus on optimizing either local costs or a global cost, there
remains a need for further exploration of their interconnections. This paper
specifically focuses on a scenario where agents collaborate towards a common
task (i.e., optimizing a global cost equal to aggregated local costs) while
effectively having distinct individual tasks (i.e., optimizing individual local
parameters in a local cost). Each agent's actions can potentially impact other
agents' performance through interactions. Notably, each agent has access to
only its local zeroth-order oracle (i.e., cost function value) and shares
scalar values, rather than gradient vectors, with other agents, leading to
communication bandwidth efficiency and agent privacy. Agents employ
zeroth-order optimization to update their parameters, and the asynchronous
message-passing between them is subject to bounded but possibly random
communication delays. This paper presents theoretical convergence analyses and
establishes a convergence rate for nonconvex problems. Furthermore, it
addresses the relevant use-case of deep learning-based resource allocation in
communication networks and conducts numerical experiments in which agents,
acting as transmitters, collaboratively train their individual policies to
maximize a global reward, e.g., a sum of data rates.

problems: Sigmoidal Mirror descent with a Projected Latent variable (SiMPL).
The SiMPL method (pronounced as "the simple method") optimizes a design using
only first-order derivative information of the objective function. The bound
constraints on the density field are enforced with the help of the (negative)
Fermi--Dirac entropy, which is also used to define a non-symmetric distance
function called a Bregman divergence on the set of admissible designs. This
Bregman divergence leads to a simple update rule that is further simplified
with the help of a so-called latent variable. Because the SiMPL method involves
discretizing the latent variable, it produces a sequence of pointwise-feasible
iterates, even when high-order finite elements are used in the discretization.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method outperforms other popular
first-order optimization algorithms. To outline the general applicability of
the technique, we include examples with (self-load) compliance minimization and
compliant mechanism optimization problems.

of cycling as a viable mode for commuting, despite the evident benefits of
(e-)bikes as sustainable, efficient, and health-promoting transportation modes.
Bike network planning is a tedious process, relying on heuristic computational
methods that frequently overlook the broader implications of introducing new
cycling infrastructure, in particular the necessity to repurpose car lanes. In
this work, we call for optimizing the trade-off between bike and car networks,
effectively pushing for Pareto optimality. This shift in perspective gives rise
to a novel linear programming formulation towards optimal bike network
allocation. Our experiments, conducted using both real-world and synthetic
data, testify the effectiveness and superiority of this optimization approach
compared to heuristic methods. In particular, the framework provides
stakeholders with a range of lane reallocation scenarios, illustrating
potential bike network enhancements and their implications for car
infrastructure. Crucially, our approach is adaptable to various bikeability and
car accessibility evaluation criteria, making our tool a highly flexible and
scalable resource for urban planning. This paper presents an advanced
decision-support framework that can significantly aid urban planners in making
informed decisions on cycling infrastructure development.

G(u)$ with $\alpha\in[0,+\infty)$, where $u$ varies in a set $U\neq\emptyset$
(without further structure). We first show that, excluding at most countably
many values of $\alpha$, we have that $\inf_{H_\alpha^\star}G=
\sup_{H_\alpha^\star}G$, where $H_\alpha^\star := \arg \min_U H_\alpha$, which
is assumed to be non-empty. We further prove a stronger result that concerns
the {invariance of the} limiting value of the functional $G$ along minimizing
sequences for $H_\alpha$. This fact in turn implies an unexpected consequence
for functionals regularized with uniformly convex norms: excluding again at
most countably many values of $\alpha$, it turns out that for a minimizing
sequence, convergence to a minimizer in the weak or strong sense is equivalent.

                                        <span>  When using machine learning for automated prediction, it is important to
account for fairness in the prediction. Fairness in machine learning aims to
ensure that biases in the data and model inaccuracies do not lead to
discriminatory decisions. E.g., predictions from fair machine learning models
should not discriminate against sensitive variables such as sexual orientation
and ethnicity. The training data often in obtained from social surveys. In
social surveys, oftentimes the data collection process is a strata sampling,
e.g. due to cost restrictions. In strata samples, the assumption of
independence between the observation is not fulfilled. Hence, if the machine
learning models do not account for the strata correlations, the results may be
biased. Especially high is the bias in cases where the strata assignment is
correlated to the variable of interest. We present in this paper an algorithm
that can handle both problems simultaneously, and we demonstrate the impact of
stratified sampling on the quality of fair machine learning predictions in a
reproducible simulation study.

                                        <span>  To ensure unbiased and ethical automated predictions, fairness must be a core
principle in machine learning applications. Fairness in machine learning aims
to mitigate biases present in the training data and model imperfections that
could lead to discriminatory outcomes. This is achieved by preventing the model
from making decisions based on sensitive characteristics like ethnicity or
sexual orientation. A fundamental assumption in machine learning is the
independence of observations. However, this assumption often does not hold true
for data describing social phenomena, where data points are often clustered
based. Hence, if the machine learning models do not account for the cluster
correlations, the results may be biased. Especially high is the bias in cases
where the cluster assignment is correlated to the variable of interest. We
present a fair mixed effects support vector machine algorithm that can handle
both problems simultaneously. With a reproducible simulation study we
demonstrate the impact of clustered data on the quality of fair machine
learning predictions.

generic tensor to a variety of rank-one tensors. The Euclidean Distance (ED)
degree of the Segre-Veronese variety counts the number of complex critical
points of this optimization problem. We regard this invariant as a function of
inner products. We prove that Frobenius inner product is a local minimum of the
ED degree, and conjecture that it is a global minimum. We prove our conjecture
in the case of matrices and symmetric binary and $3\times 3\times 3$ tensors.
We discuss the above optimization problem for other algebraic varieties,
classifying all possible values of the ED degree. Our approach combines tools
from Singularity Theory, Morse Theory, and Algebraic Geometry.

concentration properties of spectral projectors on manifolds, in connection
with the uncertainty principle. In arXiv:2401.14977, the second author proved
an optimal uncertainty principle for the spectral projector of the Laplacian on
the hyperbolic half-plane. The aim of the present work is to generalize this
condition to surfaces with hyperbolic ends. In particular, we tackle the case
of cusps, in which the volume of balls of fixed radius is not bounded from
below. We establish that spectral estimates hold from sets satisfying a
thickness condition, with a proof based on propagation of smallness estimates
of Carleman and Logunov--Malinnikova type. We also prove the converse, namely
the necessary character of the thickness condition, on any smooth manifold with
Ricci curvature bounded from below.

case where the disturbance is sub-Gaussian, correlated, and possibly
adversarial. First, we consider the case with noncentral (nonzero-mean)
disturbances for which the ordinary least-squares (OLS) method fails to
correctly identify the system. We prove that the $l_1$-norm estimator
accurately identifies the system under the condition that each disturbance has
equal probabilities of being positive or negative. This condition restricts the
sign of each disturbance but allows its magnitude to be arbitrary. Second, we
consider the case where each disturbance is adversarial with the model that the
attack times happen occasionally but the distributions of the attack values are
arbitrary. We show that when the probability of having an attack at a given
time is less than 0.5 and each attack spans the entire space in expectation,
the $l_1$-norm estimator prevails against any adversarial noncentral
disturbances and the exact recovery is achieved within a finite time. These
results pave the way to effectively defend against arbitrarily large noncentral
attacks in safety-critical systems.

                                        <span>  This paper proposes a novel termination criterion, termed the advantage gap
function, for finite state and action Markov decision processes (MDP) and
reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating this advantage gap function into
the design of step size rules and deriving a new linear rate of convergence
that is independent of the stationary state distribution of the optimal policy,
we demonstrate that policy gradient methods can solve MDPs in
strongly-polynomial time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
that such strong convergence properties have been established for policy
gradient methods. Moreover, in the stochastic setting, where only stochastic
estimates of policy gradients are available, we show that the advantage gap
function provides close approximations of the optimality gap for each
individual state and exhibits a sublinear rate of convergence at every state.
The advantage gap function can be easily estimated in the stochastic case, and
when coupled with easily computable upper bounds on policy values, they provide
a convenient way to validate the solutions generated by policy gradient
methods. Therefore, our developments offer a principled and computable measure
of optimality for RL, whereas current practice tends to rely on
algorithm-to-algorithm or baselines comparisons with no certificate of
optimality.

                                        <span>  We investigate the problem of representing moment sequences by measures in
the context ofPolynomial Optimization Problems, that consist in finding the
infimum of a real polynomial ona real semialgebraic set defined by polynomial
inequalities. We analyze the exactness of MomentMatrix (MoM) hierarchies, dual
to the Sum of Squares (SoS) hierarchies, which are sequences ofconvex cones
introduced by Lasserre to approximate measures and positive polynomials.
Weinvestigate in particular flat truncation properties, which allow testing
effectively when MoMexactness holds and recovering the minimizers.We show that
the dual of the MoM hierarchy coincides with the SoS hierarchy extendedwith the
real radical of the support of the defining quadratic module Q. We deduce
thatflat truncation happens if and only if the support of the quadratic module
associated withthe minimizers is of dimension zero. We also bound the order of
the hierarchy at which flattruncation holds.As corollaries, we show that flat
truncation and MoM exactness hold when regularityconditions, known as Boundary
Hessian Conditions, hold (and thus that MoM exactness holdsgenerically); and
when the support of the quadratic module Q is zero-dimensional.
Effectivenumerical computations illustrate these flat truncation properties.

unconstrained quadratic portfolio optimisations has an upper bound dependent on
the condition number of the covariance matrix. This is known to imply that
better conditioned covariance matrices produce weights from unconstrained
mean-variance optimisations that are better aligned with each assets expected
return. Here we relate the inequality between the alpha-weight angle and the
condition number to extend the result to include portfolio optimisations with
gearing constraints to provide an extended family of robust optimisations. We
use this to argue that in general the equally weighted portfolio is not
preferable to the mean-variance portfolio even with poor forecast ability and a
badly conditioned covariance matrix. We confirm the distribution free
theoretical arguments with a simple Gaussian simulation.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we consider bilevel optimization problem where the lower-level
has coupled constraints, i.e. the constraints depend both on the upper- and
lower-level variables. In particular, we consider two settings for the
lower-level problem. The first is when the objective is strongly convex and the
constraints are convex with respect to the lower-level variable; The second is
when the lower-level is a linear program. We propose to utilize a barrier
function reformulation to translate the problem into an unconstrained problem.
By developing a series of new techniques, we proved that both the hyperfunction
value and hypergradient of the barrier reformulated problem (uniformly)
converge to those of the original problem under minimal assumptions. Further,
to overcome the non-Lipschitz smoothness of hyperfunction and lower-level
problem for barrier reformulated problems, we design an adaptive algorithm that
ensures a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee. We also design an algorithm
that converges to the stationary point of the original problem asymptotically
under certain assumptions. The proposed algorithms require minimal assumptions,
and to our knowledge, they are the first with convergence guarantees when the
lower-level problem is a linear program.

factorization, which is a canonical nonconvex optimization problem.
Specifically, given a rank-$r$ matrix $\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, we
prove that gradient descent (GD) can find a pair of $\epsilon$-optimal
solutions $\mathbf{X}_T\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$ and
$\mathbf{Y}_T\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, where $d\geq r$, satisfying
$\lVert\mathbf{X}_T\mathbf{Y}_T^\top-\mathbf{A}\rVert_\mathrm{F}\leq\epsilon\lVert\mathbf{A}\rVert_\mathrm{F}$
in $T=O(\kappa^2\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ iterations with high probability,
where $\kappa$ denotes the condition number of $\mathbf{A}$. Furthermore, we
prove that Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG) attains an iteration
complexity of $O(\kappa\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$, which is the best-known bound
of first-order methods for rectangular matrix factorization. Different from
small balanced random initialization in the existing literature, we adopt an
unbalanced initialization, where $\mathbf{X}_0$ is large and $\mathbf{Y}_0$ is
$0$. Moreover, our initialization and analysis can be further extended to
linear neural networks, where we prove that NAG can also attain an accelerated
linear convergence rate. In particular, we only require the width of the
network to be greater than or equal to the rank of the output label matrix. In
contrast, previous results achieving the same rate require excessive widths
that additionally depend on the condition number and the rank of the input data
matrix.

$\mu_{\text{max}}$ that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway
$L$ with unit width. The best bounds currently known on $\mu_{\max}$ are
summarized as $2.2195\ldots \leq \mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$. The lower bound
$2.2195\ldots \leq \mu_{\max}$ comes from Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of area $\mu_G :=
2.2195\ldots$. The upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$ was proved by Kallus and
Romik using extensive computer assistance. It is conjectured that the equality
$\mu_{\max} = \mu_G$ holds at the lower bound.
  We develop a new approach to the moving sofa problem by approximating it as
an infinite-dimensional convex quadratic optimization problem. The problem is
then explicitly solved using a calculus of variation based on the
Brunn-Minkowski theory. Consequently, we prove that any moving sofa satisfying
a property named the injectivity condition has an area of at most $1 + \pi^2/8
= 2.2337\dots$. The new conditional bound does not rely on any computer
assistance, yet it is much closer to the lower bound $2.2195\ldots$ of Gerver
than the computer-assisted upper bound $2.37$ of Kallus and Romik. Gerver's
sofa $S_G$, the conjectured optimum, satisfies the injectivity condition in
particular.

nonlinear systems. In practical applications, computation time is a crucial
consideration when solving nonlinear optimal control problems, especially under
real-time constraints. While linearization methods are computationally
efficient, their inherent low accuracy can compromise control precision and
overall performance. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel
approach based on the optimal control method. Firstly, the original optimal
control problem is transformed into an equivalent optimization problem, which
is resolved using the Pontryagin's maximum principle, and a superlinear
convergence algorithm is presented. Furthermore, to improve computation
efficiency, explicit formulas for computing both the gradient and hessian
matrix of the cost function are proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm is validated through simulations and experiments on a linear
quadratic regulator problem and an automatic guided vehicle trajectory tracking
problem, demonstrating its ability for real-time online precise control.

controllers. However, ensuring the existence of a solution at all times to the
QP subject to multiple CBF constraints (hereby called compatibility) is
non-trivial. We quantify the feasible control input space defined by multiple
CBFs at a state in terms of its volume. We then introduce a novel feasible
space (FS) CBF that prevents this volume from going to zero. FS-CBF is shown to
be a sufficient condition for the compatibility of multiple CBFs. For
high-dimensional systems though, finding a valid FS-CBF may be difficult due to
the limitations of existing computational hardware or theoretical approaches.
In such cases, we show empirically that imposing the feasible space volume as a
candidate FS-CBF not only enhances feasibility but also exhibits reduced
sensitivity to changes in the user-chosen parameters such as gains of the
nominal controller. Finally, paired with a global planner, we evaluate our
controller for navigation among other dynamically moving agents in the AWS
Hospital gazebo environment. The proposed controller is demonstrated to
outperform the standard CBF-QP controller in maintaining feasibility.

                                        <span>  Nonsmooth composite optimization with orthogonality constraints has a wide
range of applications in statistical learning and data science. However, this
problem is challenging due to its nonsmooth objective and computationally
expensive, non-convex constraints. In this paper, we propose a new approach
called \textbf{OBCD}, which leverages Block Coordinate Descent to address these
challenges. \textbf{OBCD} is a feasible method with a small computational
footprint. In each iteration, it updates $k$ rows of the solution matrix, where
$k \geq 2$, by globally solving a small nonsmooth optimization problem under
orthogonality constraints. We prove that the limiting points of \textbf{OBCD},
referred to as (global) block-$k$ stationary points, offer stronger optimality
than standard critical points. Furthermore, we show that \textbf{OBCD}
converges to $\epsilon$-block-$k$ stationary points with an ergodic convergence
rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$. Additionally, under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz
(KL) inequality, we establish the non-ergodic convergence rate of
\textbf{OBCD}. We also extend \textbf{OBCD} by incorporating breakpoint
searching methods for subproblem solving and greedy strategies for working set
selection. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
our approach across various tasks.

generative agents to follow instructions in the form of latent CLIP embeddings.
In this work, we present a methodology to extend the control modalities by
learning a mapping from new input modalities to the latent goal space of the
agent. We apply our approach to the challenging Minecraft domain, and extend
the goal conditioning to include the audio modality. The resulting
audio-conditioned agent is able to perform on a comparable level to the
original text-conditioned and visual-conditioned agents. Specifically, we
create an Audio-Video CLIP foundation model for Minecraft and an audio prior
network which together map audio samples to the latent goal space of the
STEVE-1 policy. Additionally, we highlight the tradeoffs that occur when
conditioning on different modalities. Our training code, evaluation code, and
Audio-Video CLIP foundation model for Minecraft are made open-source to help
foster further research into multi-modal generalist sequential decision-making

rescue (SAR) operations to enhance efficiency by enabling rescue teams to cover
large search areas in a shorter time. Reducing coverage time directly increases
the likelihood of finding the target quickly, thereby improving the chances of
a successful SAR operation. In this context, UAVs require path planning to
determine the optimal flight path that fully covers the search area in the
least amount of time. A common approach involves decomposing the search area
into a grid, where the UAV must visit all cells to achieve complete coverage.
In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Grid-based Decomposition (AGD) algorithm
that efficiently partitions polygonal search areas into grids with fewer cells.
Additionally, we utilize a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) model, compatible
with the AGD algorithm, to determine a flight path that ensures complete cell
coverage while minimizing overall coverage time. Experimental results highlight
the efficiency of the AGD algorithm in reducing coverage time (by up to 20%)
across various scenarios.

Communication systems have gained more attention as a solution for efficient
and private data streaming. This system utilizes optical cameras to receive
data from digital screens via visible light. Despite their promise, most of
them are hindered by dynamic factors such as screen refreshing and rapid camera
motion. CMOS cameras, often serving as the receivers, suffer from limited frame
rates and motion-induced image blur, which degrade overall performance. To
address these challenges, this paper unveils a novel system that utilizes event
cameras. We introduce a dynamic visual marker and design event-based tracking
algorithms to achieve fast localization and data streaming. Remarkably, the
event camera's unique capabilities mitigate issues related to screen refresh
rates and camera motion, enabling a high throughput of up to 114 Kbps in static
conditions, and a 1 cm localization accuracy with 1% bit error rate under
various camera motions.

controlling the motion system based on visual observations, providing a more
practical solution for effective tracking in dynamic environments. However,
accurate Drone Visual Active Tracking using reinforcement learning remains
challenging due to the absence of a unified benchmark, the complexity of
open-world environments with frequent interference, and the diverse motion
behavior of dynamic targets. To address these issues, we propose a unified
cross-scene cross-domain benchmark for open-world drone active tracking called
DAT. The DAT benchmark provides 24 visually complex environments to assess the
algorithms' cross-scene and cross-domain generalization abilities, and
high-fidelity modeling of realistic robot dynamics. Additionally, we propose a
reinforcement learning-based drone tracking method called R-VAT, which aims to
improve the performance of drone tracking targets in complex scenarios.
Specifically, inspired by curriculum learning, we introduce a Curriculum-Based
Training strategy that progressively enhances the agent tracking performance in
vast environments with complex interference. We design a goal-centered reward
function to provide precise feedback to the drone agent, preventing targets
farther from the center of view from receiving higher rewards than closer ones.
This allows the drone to adapt to the diverse motion behavior of open-world
targets. Experiments demonstrate that the R-VAT has about 400% improvement over
the SOTA method in terms of the cumulative reward metric.

for the both side of a finger, and to realize a motion of bending the finger
after inserting the finger into a tool (hereinafter referred to as the bending
after insertion motion). In order to know the contact points of the full finger
including the joints, we propose to fabricate a nerve inclusion flexible
epidermis by combining a flexible epidermis and a nerve line made of conductive
filaments, and estimate the contact position from the change of resistance of
the nerve line. A nerve inclusion flexible epidermis attached to a thin
fingered robotic hand was combined with a twin-armed robot and tool use
experiments were conducted. The contact information can be used for tool use,
confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method.

                                        <span>  Developing whole-body tactile skins for robots remains a challenging task, as
existing solutions often prioritize modular, one-size-fits-all designs, which,
while versatile, fail to account for the robot's specific shape and the unique
demands of its operational context. In this work, we introduce the GenTact
Toolbox, a computational pipeline for creating versatile whole-body tactile
skins tailored to both robot shape and application domain. Our pipeline
includes procedural mesh generation for conforming to a robot's topology,
task-driven simulation to refine sensor distribution, and multi-material 3D
printing for shape-agnostic fabrication. We validate our approach by creating
and deploying six capacitive sensing skins on a Franka Research 3 robot arm in
a human-robot interaction scenario. This work represents a shift from
one-size-fits-all tactile sensors toward context-driven, highly adaptable
designs that can be customized for a wide range of robotic systems and
applications.

tactile sensing apparatuses that perceive the environment through touch.
Existing contact localization methods use flat geometry and uniform sensor
distributions as a simplifying assumption, limiting their ability to be used on
3D surfaces with variable density sensing arrays. This paper studies contact
localization on an artificial skin embedded with mutual capacitance tactile
sensors, arranged non-uniformly in an unknown distribution along a semi-conical
3D geometry. A fully connected neural network is trained to localize the
touching points on the embedded tactile sensors. The studied online model
achieves a localization error of $5.7 \pm 3.0$ mm. This research contributes a
versatile tool and robust solution for contact localization that is ambiguous
in shape and internal sensor distribution.

                                        <span>  Tactile sensing is used in robotics to obtain real-time feedback during
physical interactions. Fine object manipulation is a robotic application that
benefits from a high density of sensors to accurately estimate object pose,
whereas a low sensing resolution is sufficient for collision detection.
Introducing variable sensing resolution into a single tactile sensing array can
increase the range of tactile use cases, but also invokes challenges in
localizing internal sensor positions. In this work, we present a mutual
capacitance sensor array with variable sensor density, VARSkin, along with a
localization method that determines the position of each sensor in the
non-uniform array. When tested on two distinct artificial skin patches with
concealed sensor layouts, our method achieves a localization accuracy within
$\pm 2mm$. We also provide a comprehensive error analysis, offering strategies
for further precision improvement.

                                        <span>  ObjectNav is a popular task in Embodied AI, where an agent navigates to a
target object in an unseen environment. Prior literature makes the assumption
of a static environment with stationary objects, which lacks realism. To
address this, we present a novel formulation to generalize ObjectNav to dynamic
environments with non-stationary objects, and refer to it as Portable ObjectNav
or P-ObjectNav. In our formulation, we first address several challenging issues
with dynamizing existing topological scene graphs by developing a novel method
that introduces multiple transition behaviors to portable objects in the scene.
We use this technique to dynamize Matterport3D, a popular simulator for
evaluating embodied tasks. We then present a benchmark for P-ObjectNav using a
combination of heuristic, reinforcement learning, and Large Language Model
(LLM)-based navigation approaches on the dynamized environment, while
introducing novel evaluation metrics tailored for our task. Our work
fundamentally challenges the "static-environment" notion of prior ObjectNav
work; the code and dataset for P-ObjectNav will be made publicly available to
foster research on embodied navigation in dynamic scenes. We provide an
anonymized repository for our code and dataset:

contribute to improved control, safety, power economy, etc. The ubiquitous 5G

localization of UAVs and UGVs. In this paper, we review the radio frequency
(RF) based approaches for localization. We review the RF features that can be
utilized for localization and investigate the current methods suitable for
Unmanned vehicles under two general categories: range-based and fingerprinting.
The existing state-of-the-art literature on RF-based localization for both UAVs
and UGVs is examined, and the envisioned 5G NR for localization enhancement,
and the future research direction are explored.

                                        <span>  Training general robotic policies from heterogeneous data for different tasks
is a significant challenge. Existing robotic datasets vary in different
modalities such as color, depth, tactile, and proprioceptive information, and
collected in different domains such as simulation, real robots, and human
videos. Current methods usually collect and pool all data from one domain to
train a single policy to handle such heterogeneity in tasks and domains, which
is prohibitively expensive and difficult. In this work, we present a flexible
approach, dubbed Policy Composition, to combine information across such diverse
modalities and domains for learning scene-level and task-level generalized
manipulation skills, by composing different data distributions represented with
diffusion models. Our method can use task-level composition for multi-task
manipulation and be composed with analytic cost functions to adapt policy
behaviors at inference time. We train our method on simulation, human, and real
robot data and evaluate in tool-use tasks. The composed policy achieves robust
and dexterous performance under varying scenes and tasks and outperforms
baselines from a single data source in both simulation and real-world
experiments. See https://liruiw.github.io/policycomp for more details .

                                        <span>  Multiple approaches have already been proposed to mimic real driver behaviors
in simulation. This article proposes a new one, based solely on the exploration
of undisturbed observation of intersections. From them, the behavior profiles
for each macro-maneuver will be discovered. Using the macro-maneuvers already
identified in previous works, a comparison method between trajectories with
different lengths using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is proposed, which
combined with an Expectation-Maximization (EM) inspired method, defines the
different clusters that represent the behaviors observed. This is also paired
with a Kullback-Liebler divergent (KL) criteria to define when the clusters
need to be split or merged. Finally, the behaviors for each macro-maneuver are
determined by each cluster discovered, without using any map information about
the environment and being dynamically consistent with vehicle motion. By
observation it becomes clear that the two main factors for driver's behavior
are their assertiveness and interaction with other road users.

                                        <span>  Scene rearrangement, like table tidying, is a challenging task in robotic
manipulation due to the complexity of predicting diverse object arrangements.
Web-scale trained generative models such as Stable Diffusion can aid by
generating natural scenes as goals. To facilitate robot execution, object-level
representations must be extracted to match the real scenes with the generated
goals and to calculate object pose transformations. Current methods typically
use a multi-step design that involves separate models for generation,
segmentation, and feature encoding, which can lead to a low success rate due to
error accumulation. Furthermore, they lack control over the viewing
perspectives of the generated goals, restricting the tasks to 3-DoF settings.
In this paper, we propose PACA, a zero-shot pipeline for scene rearrangement
that leverages perspective-aware cross-attention representation derived from
Stable Diffusion. Specifically, we develop a representation that integrates
generation, segmentation, and feature encoding into a single step to produce
object-level representations. Additionally, we introduce perspective control,
thus enabling the matching of 6-DoF camera views and extending past approaches
that were limited to 3-DoF top-down views. The efficacy of our method is
demonstrated through its zero-shot performance in real robot experiments across
various scenes, achieving an average matching accuracy and execution success
rate of 87% and 67%, respectively.

                                        <span>  Mobile robots are used in various fields, from deliveries to search and
rescue applications. Different types of sensors are mounted on the robot to
provide accurate navigation and, thus, allow successful completion of its task.
In real-world scenarios, due to environmental constraints, the robot frequently
relies only on its inertial sensors. Therefore, due to noises and other error
terms associated with the inertial readings, the navigation solution drifts in
time. To mitigate the inertial solution drift, we propose the MoRPINet
framework consisting of a neural network to regress the robot's travelled
distance. To this end, we require the mobile robot to maneuver in a snake-like
slithering motion to encourage nonlinear behavior. MoRPINet was evaluated using
a dataset of 290 minutes of inertial recordings during field experiments and
showed an improvement of 33% in the positioning error over other
state-of-the-art methods for pure inertial navigation.

RKHS-BA. It uses continuous landmark representations that encode RGB-D/LiDAR

correspondence-free pose graph formulation, the proposed system constructs a
loss function that achieves more generalized convergence than classical
point-wise convergence. We demonstrate its applications in multi-view point
cloud registration, sliding-window odometry, and global LiDAR mapping on

noisy scenes and exhibits strong generalization with various types of semantic

algorithms that operate within manufacturer-defined payload limits. Our
empirical analysis of the Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that this
approach unnecessarily restricts the robot's dynamically-reachable task space.
These results establish an expanded operational envelope for such robots,
showing that they can handle payloads of more than twice their rated capacity.
Additionally, our preliminary findings indicate that integrating non-prehensile
motion primitives with grasping-based manipulation has the potential to further
increase the success rates of manipulation tasks involving payloads exceeding
nominal limits.

                                        <span>  Platforms that run artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines on edge computing
resources are transforming the fields of animal ecology and biodiversity,
enabling novel wildlife studies in animals' natural habitats. With emerging
remote sensing hardware, e.g., camera traps and drones, and sophisticated AI
models in situ, edge computing will be more significant in future AI-driven
animal ecology (ADAE) studies. However, the study's objectives, the species of
interest, its behaviors, range, habitat, and camera placement affect the demand
for edge resources at runtime. If edge resources are under-provisioned, studies
can miss opportunities to adapt the settings of camera traps and drones to
improve the quality and relevance of captured data. This paper presents salient
features of ADAE studies that can be used to model latency, throughput
objectives, and provision edge resources. Drawing from studies that span over
fifty animal species, four geographic locations, and multiple remote sensing
methods, we characterized common patterns in ADAE studies, revealing
increasingly complex workflows involving various computer vision tasks with
strict service level objectives (SLO). ADAE workflow demands will soon exceed
individual edge devices' compute and memory resources, requiring multiple
networked edge devices to meet performance demands. We developed a framework to
scale traces from prior studies and replay them offline on representative edge
platforms, allowing us to capture throughput and latency data across edge
configurations. We used the data to calibrate queuing and machine learning
models that predict performance on unseen edge configurations, achieving errors
as low as 19%.

                                        <span>  Hybrid battery thermal management systems (HBTMS) combining active liquid
cooling and passive phase change materials (PCM) cooling have shown a potential
for the thermal management of lithium-ion batteries. However, the fill volume
of coolant and PCM in hybrid cooling systems is limited by the size and weight
of the HBTMS at high charge/discharge rates. These limitations result in
reduced convective heat transfer from the coolant during discharge. The
liquefaction rate of PCM is accelerated and the passive cooling effect is
reduced. In this paper, we propose a compact hybrid cooling system with
multi-inlet U-shaped microchannels for which the gap between channels is
embedded by PCM/aluminum foam for compactness. Nanofluid cooling (NC)
technology with better thermal conductivity is used. A pulsed flow function is
further developed for enhanced cooling (EC) with reduced power consumption. An
experimentally validated thermal-fluid dynamics model is developed to optimize
operating conditions including coolant type, cooling direction, channel height,
inlet flow rate, and cooling scheme. The results show that the hybrid cooling
solution of NC+PCM+EC adopted by HBTMS further reduces the maximum temperature
of the Li-ion battery by 3.44{\deg}C under a discharge rate of 1C at room
temperature of 25{\deg}C with only a 5% increase in power consumption, compared
to the conventional liquid cooling method for electric vehicles (EV). The
average number of battery charges has increased by about 6 to 15 percent. The
results of this study can help improve the range as well as driving safety of
new energy EV.

interoperable interfaces, development of unique Radio Access Network (RAN)
deployments remains challenging. This is especially true for military
communications, where deployments are highly specialized with limited volume.
The construction and maintenance of the RAN, which is a real time embedded
system, is an ill-defined NP problem requiring teams of specialized system
engineers, with specialized knowledge of the hardware platform. In this paper,
we introduce a RAN Domain Specific Language (RDSL(TM)) to formally describe use
cases, constraints, and multi-vendor hardware/software abstraction to allow
automation of RAN construction. In this DSL, system requirements are
declarative, and performance constraints are guaranteed by construction using
an automated system solver. Using our RAN system solver platform, Gabriel(TM)
we show how a system engineer can confidently modify RAN functionality without
knowledge of the underlying hardware. We show benefits for specific system
requirements when compared to the manually optimized, default configuration of
the Intel FlexRAN(TM), and conclude that DSL/automation driven construction of
the RAN can lead to significant power and latency benefits when the deployment
constraints are tuned for a specific case. We give examples of how constraints
and requirements can be formatted in a "Kubernetes style" YAML format which
allows the use of other tools, such as Ansible, to integrate the generation of
these requirements into higher level automation flows such as Service
Management and Orchestration (SMO).

systems subject to state and input constraints while minimizing time-varying
and a priori unknown cost functions. We propose a modular approach that
combines the online convex optimization framework and reference governors to
solve this problem. Our method is general in the sense that we do not limit our
analysis to a specific choice of online convex optimization algorithm or
reference governor. We show that the dynamic regret of the proposed framework
is bounded linearly in both the dynamic regret and the path length of the
chosen online convex optimization algorithm, even though the online convex
optimization algorithm does not account for the underlying dynamics. We prove
that a linear bound with respect to the online convex optimization algorithm's
dynamic regret is optimal, i.e., cannot be improved upon. Furthermore, for a
standard class of online convex optimization algorithms, our proposed framework
attains a bound on its dynamic regret that is linear only in the variation of
the cost functions, which is known to be an optimal bound. Finally, we
demonstrate implementation and flexibility of the proposed framework by
comparing different combinations of online convex optimization algorithms and
reference governors to control a nonlinear chemical reactor in a numerical
experiment.

alongside the rapid rise of electric vehicles (EVs), present a unique
opportunity to revolutionize energy use in apartment complexes. Generating
electricity via PV and batteries is currently cheaper and greener than relying
on grid power, which is often expensive. Yet, residents in multi-building
apartment complexes typically lack access to fast EV charging infrastructure.
To this end, this paper investigates the feasibility and energy management of
deploying commercial PV-powered battery storage and EV fast chargers within
apartment complexes in Orlando, Florida, operated by complex owners. By
modeling the complex as a grid-connected microgrid, it aims to meet residents'
energy needs, provide backup power during emergencies, and introduce a
profitable business model for property owners. To address PV power generation
uncertainty, a distributionally robust chance-constrained optimization method
using the Wasserstein metric is employed, ensuring robust and reliable
operation. The techno-economic analysis reveals that EVs powered by PV and
batteries are more cost-effective and environmentally friendly than gasoline
vehicles that EV owners can save up to 100 dollars per month by saving on fuel
costs. The results also show that integrating PV and battery systems reduces
operational costs, lowers emissions, increases resilience, and supports EV
adoption while offering a profitable business model for property owners. These
findings highlight a practical and sustainable framework for advancing clean
energy use in residential complexes.

of renewable energy, battery storage, and electric vehicles (EVs), are
accelerating the transition toward cleaner, more resilient energy systems. This
paper conducts a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of Net-Zero Energy
Buildings (NZEBs) within Florida's energy transition by 2050. The analysis
focuses on the financial advantages of integrating rooftop photovoltaic (PV)
systems, battery storage, and EVs collectively compared to reliance on grid
electricity for both existing and newly built homes in Orlando, Florida. By
leveraging federal incentives like the Investment Tax Credit and considering
energy efficiency improvements, residents can achieve significant savings.
Simulation results show that existing homes with a 9.5 kW PV system and 42.2
kWh battery are projected to generate positive returns by 2029, while newly
constructed homes meet this threshold as early as 2024. Also, rooftop solar
used to charge an EV can save up to 100 dollars per month for residents
compared to gasoline. Combining PV and battery storage not only lowers electric
bills but also enhances grid independence and resilience against grid outages.
Beyond individual savings, NZEBs contribute to grid stability by reducing
electricity demand and supporting utility-scale renewable applications. These
advancements lower infrastructure costs, help Florida residents and utilities
align with national decarbonization goals, retain approximately $23 Billion
dollars within the state and foster progress toward a sustainable, low-carbon
future.

                                        <span>  As the adoption of distributed energy resources grows, power systems are
becoming increasingly complex and vulnerable to disruptions, such as natural
disasters and cyber-physical threats. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy markets offer a
practical solution to enhance reliability and resilience during power outages
while providing monetary and technical benefits to prosumers and consumers.
This paper explores the advantages of P2P energy exchanges in active
distribution networks using a double auction mechanism, focusing on improving
system resilience during outages. Two pricing mechanisms distribution
locational marginal price (DLMP) and average price mechanism are used to
complement each other in facilitating efficient energy exchange. DLMP serves as
a price signal that reflects network conditions and acts as an upper bound for
bidding in the P2P market. Meanwhile, prosumers and consumers submit bids in
the market and agree on energy transactions based on average transaction
prices, ensuring fast matching and fair settlements. Simulation results
indicate that during emergency operation modes, DLMP prices increase, leading
to higher average transaction prices. Prosumers benefit from increased market
clearing prices, while consumers experience uninterrupted electricity supply.

operations (RPO) problem of the EP-Gemini mission. In this mission, a CubeSat
chaser is controlled to approach and circumnavigate the other uncooperative
CubeSat target. Such a problem is challenging because the chaser operates on a
single electric propulsion thruster, for which coupling between attitude
control and thrust vector, and charging of the electric propulsion system must
be taken into consideration. In addition, the access to relative states in real
time is not achievable due to the onboard hardware constraints of the two
CubeSats. The developed control framework addresses these limitations by
applying four modularized maneuver blocks to correct the chaser's mean orbit
elements in sequence. The control framework is based on a relative motion
called safety ellipse to ensure a low collision risk. The complete EP-Gemini
mission is demonstrated by the implementation of the proposed control framework
in a numerical simulation that includes high order perturbations for low Earth
orbit. The simulation result shows that a safety ellipse is established after a
41-day RPO maneuver, which consumes 44$\%$ of the total fuel in terms of
$\Delta V$. The resulting 3-dimensional safety ellipse circumnavigates the
target with an approximate dimension of 14 km $\times$ 27 km $\times$ 8 km.

                                        <span>  From 5G onwards, Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) have emerged as a key
component of future network architectures. Leveraging Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
satellite constellations, NTNs are capable of building a space Internet and
present a paradigm shift in delivering mobile services to even the most remote
regions on Earth. However, the extensive coverage and rapid movement of LEO
satellites pose unique challenges for NTN networking, including user equipment
(UE) access and inter-satellite delivery, which directly impact the quality of
service (QoS) and data transmission continuity. This paper offers an in-depth
review of advanced NTN management technologies in the context of 6G evolution,
focusing on radio resource management, mobility management, and dynamic network
slicing. Building on this foundation and considering the latest trends in NTN
development, we then present some innovative perspectives to emerging
challenges in satellite beamforming, handover mechanisms, and inter-satellite
transmissions. Lastly, we identify open research issues and propose future
directions aimed at advancing satellite Internet deployment and enhancing NTN
performance.

                                        <span>  Quantum computing comes with the potential to push computational boundaries
in various domains including, e.g., cryptography, simulation, optimization, and
machine learning. Exploiting the principles of quantum mechanics, new
algorithms can be developed with capabilities that are unprecedented by
classical computers. However, the experimental realization of quantum devices
is an active field of research with enormous open challenges, including
robustness against noise and scalability. While systems and control theory
plays a crucial role in tackling these challenges, the principles of quantum
physics lead to a (perceived) high entry barrier for entering the field of
quantum computing. This tutorial paper aims at lowering the barrier by
introducing basic concepts required to understand and solve research problems
in quantum systems. First, we introduce fundamentals of quantum algorithms,
ranging from basic ingredients such as qubits and quantum logic gates to
prominent examples and more advanced concepts, e.g., variational quantum
algorithms. Next, we formalize some engineering questions for building quantum
devices in the real world, which requires the careful manipulation of
microscopic quantities obeying quantum effects. To this end for N-level
systems, we introduce basic concepts of (bilinear) quantum systems and control
theory including controllability, observability, and optimal control in a
unified frame. Finally, we address the problem of noise in real-world quantum
systems via robust quantum control, which relies on a set-membership
uncertainty description frequently employed in control.

stochastic process. While most of the existing works have concentrated on
obtaining optimal sampling strategies, motivated by malicious attacks on
cyber-physical systems, we model sensing under surveillance as a game between
an attacker and a defender. This introduces strategic elements to conventional
remote estimation problems. Additionally, inspired by increasing detection
capabilities, we model an element of information leakage for each player.
Parameterizing the game in terms of uncertainty on each side, information
leakage, and cost of sampling, we consider the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE)
concept where one of the players acts as the leader and the other one as the
follower. By focusing our attention on stationary probabilistic sampling
policies, we characterize the SE of this game and provide simulations to show
the efficacy of our results.

is fundamentally challenging due to the fact that the size of the joint state
and action spaces are exponentially large in the number of agents. These
difficulties are exacerbated when balancing sequential global decision-making
with local agent interactions. In this work, we propose a new algorithm
\texttt{SUBSAMPLE-MFQ}
(\textbf{Subsample}-\textbf{M}ean-\textbf{F}ield-\textbf{Q}-learning) and a
decentralized randomized policy for a system with $n$ agents. For $k\leq n$,
our algorithm system learns a policy for the system in time polynomial in $k$.
We show that this learned policy converges to the optimal policy in the order
of $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ as the number of subsampled agents $k$ increases. We
validate our method empirically on Gaussian squeeze and global exploration
settings.

aspects of electric power system operation, both of which face the challenge of
coordinating efforts to enhance reliability and economic performance. This
challenge becomes increasingly pronounced in the context of increased
integration of renewable energy and flexible loads, such as wind power and
electric vehicles, into the power system, where high uncertainty is prevalent.
To tackle this issue, this paper develops a two-stage adaptive robust
optimization model for the joint unit maintenance and unit commitment strategy.
The first stage focuses on making joint decisions regarding unit maintenance
and unit commitment, while the second stage addresses economic dispatch under
the worst-case scenarios of wind power and load demand. Then a practical
solution methodology is proposed to solve this model efficiently, which
combines the inexact column-and-constraint generation algorithm with an outer
approximation method. Finally, the economic viability and adaptability of the
proposed method is demonstrated based on the RTS-79 test system.

control algorithms in the online setting with the flexibility in both active
and reactive power injections. A key challenge is to continuously track the
time-varying global optima with the robustness against dynamics inaccuracy and
communication delay. In this paper, we introduce the disturbance-action
controller by novelly formulating the voltage drop from loads as the system
disturbance. The controller alternatively generates the control input and
updates the parameters based on the interactions with grids. Under the
linearized power flow model, we provide stability conditions of the control
policy and the performance degradation to model inaccuracy. The simulation
results on the radial distribution networks show the effectiveness of proposed
controller under fluctuating loads and significant improvement on the
robustness to these challenges. Furthermore, the ability of incorporating
history information and generalization to various loads are demonstrated
through extensive experiments on the parameter sensitivity.

                                        <span>  On-device control agents, especially on mobile devices, are responsible for
operating mobile devices to fulfill users' requests, enabling seamless and
intuitive interactions. Integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into these agents enhances their ability to understand and execute complex
commands, thereby improving user experience. However, fine-tuning MLLMs for
on-device control presents significant challenges due to limited data
availability and inefficient online training processes. This paper introduces
DistRL, a novel framework designed to enhance the efficiency of online RL
fine-tuning for mobile device control agents. DistRL employs centralized
training and decentralized data acquisition to ensure efficient fine-tuning in
the context of dynamic online interactions. Additionally, the framework is
backed by our tailor-made RL algorithm, which effectively balances exploration
with the prioritized utilization of collected data to ensure stable and robust
training. Our experiments show that, on average, DistRL delivers a 3X
improvement in training efficiency and enables training data collection 2.4X
faster than the leading synchronous multi-machine methods. Notably, after
training, DistRL achieves a 20% relative improvement in success rate compared
to state-of-the-art methods on general Android tasks from an open benchmark,
significantly outperforming existing approaches while maintaining the same
training time. These results validate DistRL as a scalable and efficient
solution, offering substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
agent performance for real-world, in-the-wild device control tasks.

                                        <span>  We study a problem of optimal irreversible investment and emission reduction
formulated as a nonzero-sum dynamic game between an investor with environmental
preferences and a firm. The game is set in continuous time on an infinite-time
horizon. The firm generates profits with a stochastic dynamics and may spend
part of its revenues towards emission reduction (e.g., renovating the
infrastructure). The firm's objective is to maximize the discounted expectation
of a function of its profits. The investor participates in the profits and may
decide to invest to support the firm's production capacity. The investor uses a
profit function which accounts for both financial and environmental factors.
Nash equilibria of the game are obtained via a system of variational
inequalities. We formulate a general verification theorem for this system in a
diffusive setup and construct an explicit solution in the zero-noise limit. Our
explicit results and numerical approximations show that both the investor's and
the firm's optimal actions are triggered by moving boundaries that increase
with the total amount of emission abatement.

systems subject to state and input constraints while minimizing time-varying
and a priori unknown cost functions. We propose a modular approach that
combines the online convex optimization framework and reference governors to
solve this problem. Our method is general in the sense that we do not limit our
analysis to a specific choice of online convex optimization algorithm or
reference governor. We show that the dynamic regret of the proposed framework
is bounded linearly in both the dynamic regret and the path length of the
chosen online convex optimization algorithm, even though the online convex
optimization algorithm does not account for the underlying dynamics. We prove
that a linear bound with respect to the online convex optimization algorithm's
dynamic regret is optimal, i.e., cannot be improved upon. Furthermore, for a
standard class of online convex optimization algorithms, our proposed framework
attains a bound on its dynamic regret that is linear only in the variation of
the cost functions, which is known to be an optimal bound. Finally, we
demonstrate implementation and flexibility of the proposed framework by
comparing different combinations of online convex optimization algorithms and
reference governors to control a nonlinear chemical reactor in a numerical
experiment.

processing networks. This tractability is a due to the fact that optimal
control for such models is a solution of a Separated Continuous Linear
Programming (SCLP) problem. Recently developed revised SCLP-simplex algorithm
allows to exactly solve very large instances of SCLPs in a reasonable time.
Furthermore, to deal with the inherent stochasticity in arrival and service
rates in processing networks, robust optimization approach is applied to SCLP
models. However, a robust counterpart of SCLP problem has two important
drawbacks limiting its tractability. First, the robust counterpart of SCLP
problem is a huge SCLP problem itself, that can be in several orders of
magnitude bigger then the nominal SCLP problem. Second, robust counterpart of
SCLP is a degenerate optimization problem, that is not suitable for revised
SCLP-simplex algorithm. In this paper we develop theoretical results and a
corresponding algorithm that allows to preserve dimensions of nominal SCLP
problem and avoid degeneracy issues during solution of its robust counterpart.

                                        <span>  The autoencoder model typically uses an encoder to map data to a lower
dimensional latent space and a decoder to reconstruct it. However, relying on
an encoder for inversion can lead to suboptimal representations, particularly
limiting in physical sciences where precision is key. We introduce a
decoder-only method using gradient flow to directly encode data into the latent
space, defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This approach
eliminates the need for approximate encoder inversion. We train the decoder via
the adjoint method and show that costly integrals can be avoided with minimal
accuracy loss. Additionally, we propose a $2^{nd}$ order ODE variant,
approximating Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent for faster convergence.
To handle stiff ODEs, we use an adaptive solver that prioritizes loss
minimization, improving robustness. Compared to traditional autoencoders, our
method demonstrates explicit encoding and superior data efficiency, which is
crucial for data-scarce scenarios in the physical sciences. Furthermore, this
work paves the way for integrating machine learning into scientific workflows,
where precise and efficient encoding is critical. \footnote{The code for this

                                        <span>  Quantum computing comes with the potential to push computational boundaries
in various domains including, e.g., cryptography, simulation, optimization, and
machine learning. Exploiting the principles of quantum mechanics, new
algorithms can be developed with capabilities that are unprecedented by
classical computers. However, the experimental realization of quantum devices
is an active field of research with enormous open challenges, including
robustness against noise and scalability. While systems and control theory
plays a crucial role in tackling these challenges, the principles of quantum
physics lead to a (perceived) high entry barrier for entering the field of
quantum computing. This tutorial paper aims at lowering the barrier by
introducing basic concepts required to understand and solve research problems
in quantum systems. First, we introduce fundamentals of quantum algorithms,
ranging from basic ingredients such as qubits and quantum logic gates to
prominent examples and more advanced concepts, e.g., variational quantum
algorithms. Next, we formalize some engineering questions for building quantum
devices in the real world, which requires the careful manipulation of
microscopic quantities obeying quantum effects. To this end for N-level
systems, we introduce basic concepts of (bilinear) quantum systems and control
theory including controllability, observability, and optimal control in a
unified frame. Finally, we address the problem of noise in real-world quantum
systems via robust quantum control, which relies on a set-membership
uncertainty description frequently employed in control.

                                        <span>  We propose a novel algorithm, TR-SVR, for solving unconstrained stochastic
optimization problems. This method builds on the trust-region framework, which
effectively balances local and global exploration in optimization tasks. TR-SVR
incorporates variance reduction techniques to improve both computational
efficiency and stability when addressing stochastic objective functions. The
algorithm applies a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) approach within the
trust-region framework, solving each subproblem approximately using
variance-reduced gradient estimators. This integration ensures a robust
convergence mechanism while maintaining efficiency, making TR-SVR particularly
suitable for large-scale stochastic optimization challenges.

                                        <span>  Designing efficient algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
is fundamentally challenging due to the fact that the size of the joint state
and action spaces are exponentially large in the number of agents. These
difficulties are exacerbated when balancing sequential global decision-making
with local agent interactions. In this work, we propose a new algorithm
\texttt{SUBSAMPLE-MFQ}
(\textbf{Subsample}-\textbf{M}ean-\textbf{F}ield-\textbf{Q}-learning) and a
decentralized randomized policy for a system with $n$ agents. For $k\leq n$,
our algorithm system learns a policy for the system in time polynomial in $k$.
We show that this learned policy converges to the optimal policy in the order
of $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ as the number of subsampled agents $k$ increases. We
validate our method empirically on Gaussian squeeze and global exploration
settings.

                                        <span>  Bilevel optimization has gained considerable attention due to its broad
applicability across various fields. While several studies have investigated
the convergence rates in the strongly-convex-strongly-convex (SC-SC) setting,
no prior work has proven that a single-loop algorithm can achieve linear
convergence. This paper employs a small-gain theorem in {robust control theory}
to demonstrate that a single-loop algorithm based on the implicit function
theorem attains a linear convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\rho^{k})$, where
$\rho\in(0,1)$ is specified in Theorem 3. Specifically, We model the algorithm
as a dynamical system by identifying its two interconnected components: the
controller (the gradient or approximate gradient functions) and the plant (the
update rule of variables). We prove that each component exhibits a bounded gain
and that, with carefully designed step sizes, their cascade accommodates a
product gain strictly less than one. Consequently, the overall algorithm can be
proven to achieve a linear convergence rate, as guaranteed by the small-gain
theorem. The gradient boundedness assumption adopted in the single-loop
algorithm (\cite{hong2023two, chen2022single}) is replaced with a gradient
Lipschitz assumption in Assumption 2.2. To the best of our knowledge, this work
is first-known result on linear convergence for a single-loop algorithm.

problems. The prevalent approaches are first-order methods, valued for their
scalability. These methods are implemented to tackle highly irregular problems
where assumptions of convexity and smoothness are untenable.
  Seeking to deepen the understanding of these methods, we study first-order
methods with constant step size for minimizing locally Lipschitz tame
functions. To do so, we propose notions of discrete Lyapunov stability for
optimization methods. Concerning common first-order methods, we provide
necessary and sufficient conditions for stability. We also show that certain
local minima can be unstable, without additional noise in the method. Our
analysis relies on the connection between the iterates of the first-order
methods and continuous-time dynamics.

                                        <span>  The increasing scale and complexity of global supply chains have led to new
challenges spanning various fields, such as supply chain disruptions due to
long waiting lines at the ports, material shortages, and inflation. Coupled
with the size of supply chains and the availability of vast amounts of data,
efforts towards tackling such challenges have led to an increasing interest in
applying machine learning methods in many aspects of supply chains. Unlike
other solutions, ML techniques, including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and
Neural Networks, make predictions and approximate optimal solutions faster.
This paper presents an automated ML framework to enhance supply chain security
by detecting fraudulent activities, predicting maintenance needs, and
forecasting material backorders. Using datasets of varying sizes, results show
that fraud detection achieves an 88% accuracy rate using sampling methods,
machine failure prediction reaches 93.4% accuracy, and material backorder
prediction achieves 89.3% accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning significantly
improved the performance of these models, with certain supervised techniques
like XGBoost and LightGBM reaching up to 100% precision. This research
contributes to supply chain security by streamlining data preprocessing,
feature selection, model optimization, and inference deployment, addressing
critical challenges and boosting operational efficiency.

dual solution of a target optimization problem. Our framework applies to the
standard case where the objective function is composed of two components: a
closed, proper, convex function with Lipschitz-smooth gradient and another
closed, proper, convex function. We show that the RYU framework not only
encompasses but also improves upon the state-of-the-art methods proposed over
the past decade for this class of optimization problems.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we consider constrained optimization problems with convex,
smooth objective and constraints. We propose a new stochastic gradient
algorithm, called the Stochastic Moving Ball Approximation (SMBA) method, to
solve this class of problems, where at each iteration we first take a gradient
step for the objective function and then perform a projection step onto one
ball approximation of a randomly chosen constraint. The computational
simplicity of SMBA, which uses first-order information and considers only one
constraint at a time, makes it suitable for large-scale problems with many
functional constraints. We provide a convergence analysis for the SMBA
algorithm using basic assumptions on the problem, that yields new convergence
rates in both optimality and feasibility criteria evaluated at some average
point. Our convergence proofs are novel since we need to deal properly with
infeasible iterates and with quadratic upper approximations of constraints that
may yield empty balls. We derive convergence rates of order $\mathcal{O}
(k^{-1/2})$ when the objective function is convex, and $\mathcal{O} (k^{-1})$
when the objective function is strongly convex. Preliminary numerical
experiments on quadratically constrained quadratic problems demonstrate the
viability and performance of our method when compared to some existing
state-of-the-art optimization methods and software.

                                        <span>  In this paper we consider finite sum composite convex optimization problems
with many functional constraints. The objective function is expressed as a
finite sum of two terms, one of which admits easy computation of (sub)gradients
while the other is amenable to proximal evaluations. We assume a generalized
bounded gradient condition on the objective which allows us to simultaneously
tackle both smooth and nonsmooth problems. We also consider the cases of both
with and without a strong convexity property. Further, we assume that each
constraint set is given as the level set of a convex but not necessarily
differentiable function. We reformulate the constrained finite sum problem into
a stochastic optimization problem for which the stochastic subgradient
projection method from [17] specializes to a collection of mini-batch variants,
with different mini-batch sizes for the objective function and functional
constraints, respectively. More specifically, at each iteration, our algorithm
takes a mini-batch stochastic proximal subgradient step aimed at minimizing the
objective function and then a subsequent mini-batch subgradient projection step
minimizing the feasibility violation. By specializing different mini-batching
strategies, we derive exact expressions for the stepsizes as a function of the
mini-batch size and in some cases we also derive insightful stepsize-switching
rules which describe when one should switch from a constant to a decreasing
stepsize regime. We also prove sublinear convergence rates for the mini-batch
subgradient projection algorithm which depend explicitly on the mini-batch
sizes and on the properties of the objective function. Numerical results also
show a better performance of our mini-batch scheme over its single-batch
counterpart.

                                        <span>  In this paper we consider convex optimization problems with stochastic
composite objective function subject to (possibly) infinite intersection of
constraints. The objective function is expressed in terms of expectation
operator over a sum of two terms satisfying a stochastic bounded gradient
condition, with or without strong convexity type properties. In contrast to the
classical approach, where the constraints are usually represented as
intersection of simple sets, in this paper we consider that each constraint set
is given as the level set of a convex but not necessarily differentiable
function. Based on the flexibility offered by our general optimization model we
consider a stochastic subgradient method with random feasibility updates. At
each iteration, our algorithm takes a stochastic proximal (sub)gradient step
aimed at minimizing the objective function and then a subsequent subgradient
step minimizing the feasibility violation of the observed random constraint. We
analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm for diminishing
stepsizes and for the case when the objective function is convex or strongly
convex, unifying the nonsmooth and smooth cases. We prove sublinear convergence
rates for this stochastic subgradient algorithm, which are known to be optimal
for subgradient methods on this class of problems. When the objective function
has a linear least-square form and the constraints are polyhedral, it is shown
that the algorithm converges linearly. Numerical evidence supports the
effectiveness of our method in real problems.

nonconvex problems and extraordinary numerical performance, but the study of
its performance in convex optimization is somehow limited. This paper
complements the existing literature by presenting a universal trust-region
method that simultaneously incorporates the quadratic regularization and ball
constraint. In particular, we introduce a novel descent property tailored for
trust-region-type algorithms, enabling us to unify and streamline the analysis
for both convex and nonconvex optimization. Our method exhibits an iteration
complexity of $\tilde O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ to find an $\epsilon$-approximate
second-order stationary point for nonconvex optimization. Meanwhile, the
analysis reveals that the universal method attains an $O(\epsilon^{-1/2})$
complexity bound for convex optimization. Finally, we develop an adaptive
universal method to address practical implementations. The numerical results
show the effectiveness of our method in both nonconvex and convex problems.

optimizations using a Hessian fitting criterion from the preconditioned
stochastic gradient descent (PSGD) method, which is intimately related to many
commonly used second-order and adaptive gradient optimizers, e.g., BFGS,
Gaussian-Newton algorithm, natural gradient descent, AdaGrad, etc. Our analyses
reveal the efficiency and reliability differences among a wide range of
preconditioner fitting methods, from closed-form to iterative solutions, using
Hessian-vector products or stochastic gradients only, with Hessian fittings in
the Euclidean space, the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPL)
matrices, to a variety of Lie groups. The most intriguing discovery is that the
Hessian fitting itself as an optimization problem is strongly convex under mild
conditions in certain general Lie groups. This discovery turns Hessian fitting
into a well-behaved Lie group optimization problem and facilitates the designs
of highly efficient and elegant Lie group sparse preconditioner fitting methods
for large-scale stochastic optimizations.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we introduce an algorithm designed to address the problem of
time-optimal formation reshaping in three-dimensional environments while
preventing collisions between agents. The utility of the proposed approach is
particularly evident in mobile robotics, where agents benefit from being
organized and navigated in formation for a variety of real-world applications
requiring frequent alterations in formation shape for efficient navigation or
task completion. Given the constrained operational time inherent to
battery-powered mobile robots, the time needed to complete the formation
reshaping process is crucial for their efficient operation, especially in case
of multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed Collision-Aware
Time-Optimal formation Reshaping Algorithm (CAT-ORA) builds upon the Hungarian
algorithm for the solution of the robot-to-goal assignment implementing the
inter-agent collision avoidance through direct constraints on mutually
exclusive robot-goal pairs combined with a trajectory generation approach
minimizing the duration of the reshaping process. Theoretical validations
confirm the optimality of CAT-ORA, with its efficacy further showcased through
simulations, and a real-world outdoor experiment involving 19 UAVs. Thorough
numerical analysis shows the potential of CAT-ORA to decrease the time required
to perform complex formation reshaping tasks by up to 49%, and 12% on average
compared to commonly used methods in randomly generated scenarios.

                                        <span>  A painting is more than just a picture on a wall; a painting is a process
comprised of many intentional brush strokes, the shapes of which are an
important component of a painting's overall style and message. Prior work in
modeling brush stroke trajectories either does not work with real-world
robotics or is not flexible enough to capture the complexity of human-made
brush strokes. In this work, we introduce Spline-FRIDA which can model complex
human brush stroke trajectories. This is achieved by recording artists drawing
using motion capture, modeling the extracted trajectories with an autoencoder,
and introducing a novel brush stroke dynamics model to the existing robotic
painting platform FRIDA. We conducted a survey and found that our open-source
Spline-FRIDA approach successfully captures the stroke styles in human drawings
and that Spline-FRIDA's brush strokes are more human-like, improve semantic
planning, and are more artistic compared to existing robot painting systems
with restrictive B\'ezier curve strokes.

layouts while preserving a realistic background environment. Compared to the
synthetic data generation frameworks where Lidar point clouds are generated
from scratch, our framework focuses on new scenario generation in a given
background environment, and our method also provides labels for the generated
data. This approach ensures the generated data remains relevant to the specific
environment, aiding both the development and the evaluation of algorithms in
real-world scenarios. Compared with novel view synthesis, our framework allows
the creation of counterfactual scenarios with significant changes in the object
layout and does not rely on multi-frame optimization. In our framework, the
object removal and insertion are supported by generative background inpainting
and object point cloud completion, and the entire pipeline is built upon
spherical voxelization, which realizes the correct Lidar projective geometry by
construction. Experiments show that our framework generates realistic Lidar
scans with object layout changes and benefits the development of Lidar-based
self-driving systems.

                                        <span>  Rapid autonomous traversal of unstructured terrain is essential for scenarios
such as disaster response, search and rescue, or planetary exploration. As a
vehicle navigates at the limit of its capabilities over extreme terrain, its
dynamics can change suddenly and dramatically. For example, high-speed and
varying terrain can affect parameters such as traction, tire slip, and rolling
resistance. To achieve effective planning in such environments, it is crucial
to have a dynamics model that can accurately anticipate these conditions. In
this work, we present a hybrid model that predicts the changing dynamics
induced by the terrain as a function of visual inputs. We leverage a
pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) DINOv2, which provides rich features
that encode fine-grained semantic information. To use this dynamics model for
planning, we propose an end-to-end training architecture for a projection
distance independent feature encoder that compresses the information from the
VFM, enabling the creation of a lightweight map of the environment at runtime.
We validate our architecture on an extensive dataset (hundreds of kilometers of
aggressive off-road driving) collected across multiple locations as part of the
DARPA Robotic Autonomy in Complex Environments with Resiliency (RACER) program.

the complexity of human behavior in dynamic and obstacle-rich environments. In
this work, we propose a dynamic weight adjustment scheme using a neural network
to predict the optimal weights of objectives in an optimization-based motion
planner. We adopt a spatial-temporal trajectory planner and incorporate diverse
objectives to achieve a balance among safety, efficiency, and goal achievement
in complex and dynamic environments. We design the network structure,
observation encoding, and reward function to effectively train the policy
network using reinforcement learning, allowing the robot to adapt its behavior
in real time based on environmental and pedestrian information. Simulation
results show improved safety compared to the fixed-weight planner and the
state-of-the-art learning-based methods, and verify the ability of the learned
policy to adaptively adjust the weights based on the observed situations. The
approach's feasibility is demonstrated in a navigation task using an autonomous
delivery robot across a crowded corridor over a 300 m distance.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight learning from demonstration
(LfD) model based on reservoir computing that can learn and generate multiple
movement trajectories with prediction intervals, which we call as Context-based
Echo State Network with prediction confidence (CESN+). CESN+ can generate
movement trajectories that may go beyond the initial LfD training based on a
desired set of conditions while providing confidence on its generated output.
To assess the abilities of CESN+, we first evaluate its performance against
Conditional Neural Movement Primitives (CNMP), a comparable framework that uses
a conditional neural process to generate movement primitives. Our findings
indicate that CESN+ not only outperforms CNMP but is also faster to train and
demonstrates impressive performance in generating trajectories for
extrapolation cases. In human-robot shared control applications, the confidence
of the machine generated trajectory is a key indicator of how to arbitrate
control sharing. To show the usability of the CESN+ for human-robot adaptive
shared control, we have designed a proof-of-concept human-robot shared control
task and tested its efficacy in adapting the sharing weight between the human
and the robot by comparing it to a fixed-weight control scheme. The simulation
experiments show that with CESN+ based adaptive sharing the total human load in
shared control can be significantly reduced. Overall, the developed CESN+ model
is a strong lightweight LfD system with desirable properties such fast training
and ability to extrapolate to the new task parameters while producing robust
prediction intervals for its output.

degrade over time. This degradation is influenced by the nature of the tasks
performed by the robot. Tasks with higher severity, such as handling heavy
payloads, can accelerate the degradation process. One way this degradation is
reflected is in the position accuracy of the robot's end-effector. In this
paper, we present a prognostic modeling framework that predicts a robotic
manipulator's Remaining Useful Life (RUL) while accounting for the effects of
task severity. Our framework represents the robot's position accuracy as a
Brownian motion process with a random drift parameter that is influenced by
task severity. The dynamic nature of task severity is modeled using a
continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). To evaluate RUL, we discuss two approaches

(RLD), and (2) Monte Carlo simulations, commonly used in prognostics
literature. Theoretical results establish the equivalence between these RUL
computation approaches. We validate our framework through experiments using two
distinct physics-based simulators for planar and spatial robot fleets. Our
findings show that robots in both fleets experience shorter RUL when handling a
higher proportion of high-severity tasks.

                                        <span>  Humans navigate unfamiliar environments using the capabilities of episodic
simulation and episodic memory. Developing imagination-based memory, analogous
to episodic simulation and episodic memory, can enhance embodied agents'
comprehension of the complex relationship between environments and objects.
However, existing Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents fail to perform
the aforementioned mechanism. We propose a novel architecture to help agents
build a recurrent imaginative memory system. Specifically, the agent can
maintain a reality-imagination hybrid global memory during navigation and
expand the memory map through imaginative mechanisms and navigation actions.
Correspondingly, we design a series of pre-training tasks to help the agent
acquire fine-grained imaginative abilities. Our agents improve the
state-of-the-art (SoTA) success rate (SR) by 7% while simultaneously imagining
high-fidelity RGB representations for future scenes.

                                        <span>  Scenario-based virtual testing is one of the most significant methods to test
and evaluate the safety of automated driving systems (ADSs). However, it is
impractical to enumerate all concrete scenarios in a logical scenario space and
test them exhaustively. Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) was introduced
to accelerate the scenario-based test of ADSs by utilizing the historical test
information to generate new test cases. However, a single optimum found by the
BBO algorithm is insufficient for the purpose of a comprehensive safety
evaluation of ADSs in a logical scenario. In fact, all the subspaces
representing danger in the logical scenario space, rather than only the most
critical concrete scenario, play a more significant role for the safety
evaluation. Covering as many of the critical concrete scenarios in a logical
scenario space through a limited number of tests is defined as the Black-Box
Coverage (BBC) problem in this paper. We formalized this problem in a
sample-based search paradigm and constructed a coverage criterion with
Confusion Matrix Analysis. Furthermore, we propose LAMBDA (Latent-Action
Monte-Carlo Beam Search with Density Adaption) to solve BBC problems. LAMBDA
can quickly focus on critical subspaces by recursively partitioning the logical
scenario space into accepted and rejected parts. Compared with its predecessor
LaMCTS, LAMBDA introduces sampling density to overcome the sampling bias from
optimization and Beam Search to obtain more parallelizability. Experimental
results show that LAMBDA achieves state-of-the-art performance among all
baselines and can reach at most 33 and 6000 times faster than Random Search to
get 95% coverage of the critical areas in 2- and 5-dimensional synthetic
functions, respectively. Experiments also demonstrate that LAMBDA has a
promising future in the safety evaluation of ADSs in virtual tests.

tasks, such as facilitating human-machine interactions and transporting
objects. Increasing the number of actuators can enhance the robot's capacity,
but controlling them requires communication bandwidth to increase equally in
order to avoid time delays. We propose a novel control method that has constant
time delays no matter how many actuators are in the robot. Having a distributed
nature, the method first approximates target shapes, then broadcasts the
approximation coefficients to the actuators, and relies on themselves to
compute the inputs. We build a robotic pin array and measure the time delay as
a function of the number of actuators to confirm the system size-independent
scaling behavior. The shape-changing ability is achieved based on function
approximation algorithms, i.e. discrete cosine transform or matching pursuit.
We perform experiments to approximate target shapes and make quantitative
comparison with those obtained from standard sequential control method. A good
agreement between the experiments and theoretical predictions is achieved, and
our method is more efficient in the sense that it requires less control
messages to generate shapes with the same accuracy. Our method is also capable
of dynamic tasks such as object manipulation.

possibilities for human-robot interaction, especially in collaborative
environments. However, Real-time human-AI collaboration requires agents to
adapt to unseen human behaviors while maintaining effective communication
dynamically. Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating such adaptability for
embodied agents, focusing mostly on the task performance of the agent itself.
To address this gap, we propose a novel benchmark that assesses agents'
reactive adaptability and instantaneous communication capabilities at every
step. Based on this benchmark, we propose a Monitor-then-Adapt framework
(MonTA), combining strong adaptability and communication with real-time
execution. MonTA contains three key LLM modules, a lightweight \textit{Monitor}
for monitoring the need for adaptation in high frequency, and two proficient
\textit{Adapters} for subtask and path adaptation reasoning in low frequency.
Our results demonstrate that MonTA outperforms other baseline agents on our
proposed benchmark. Further user studies confirm the high reasonability
adaptation plan and consistent language instruction provided by our framework.

introduce ARMOR, a novel egocentric perception system that integrates both
hardware and software, specifically incorporating wearable-like depth sensors
for humanoid robots. Our distributed perception approach enhances the robot's
spatial awareness, and facilitates more agile motion planning. We also train a
transformer-based imitation learning (IL) policy in simulation to perform
dynamic collision avoidance, by leveraging around 86 hours worth of human
realistic motions from the AMASS dataset. We show that our ARMOR perception is
superior against a setup with multiple dense head-mounted, and externally
mounted depth cameras, with a 63.7% reduction in collisions, and 78.7%
improvement on success rate. We also compare our IL policy against a
sampling-based motion planning expert cuRobo, showing 31.6% less collisions,
16.9% higher success rate, and 26x reduction in computational latency. Lastly,
we deploy our ARMOR perception on our real-world GR1 humanoid from Fourier
Intelligence. We are going to update the link to the source code, HW

explore the feasibility of foundation models for applications in the control

address this challenge by pretraining a transformer-based foundation model

prediction tasks across different dynamical systems, which we validate in
simulation and hardware experiments, including cart-pole and Furuta pendulum

increase performance even further. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of

shared, constrained, and narrow spaces is a complex problem and essential for
many scenarios such as construction, surgery, and more. Traditional coupled and
decoupled methods either scale poorly or lack completeness, and hybrid methods
that compose paths from individual robots together require the enumeration of
many paths before they can find valid composite solutions. This paper
introduces Scheduling to Avoid Collisions (StAC), a hybrid approach that more
effectively composes paths from individual robots by scheduling (adding random
stops and coordination motion along each path) and generates paths that are
more likely to be feasible by using bidirectional feedback between the
scheduler and motion planner for informed sampling. StAC uses 10 to 100 times
fewer paths from the low-level planner than state-of-the-art baselines on
challenging problems in manipulator cases.

                                        <span>  In the field of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS), the accurate
modeling of ship maneuvering motion for harbor maneuvers is a crucial
technology. Non-parametric system identification (SI) methods, which do not
require prior knowledge of the target ship, have the potential to produce
accurate maneuvering models using observed data. However, the modeling accuracy
significantly depends on the distribution of the available data. To address
these issues, we propose a probabilistic prediction method of maneuvering
motion that incorporates ensemble learning into a non-parametric SI using
feedforward neural networks. This approach captures the epistemic uncertainty
caused by insufficient or unevenly distributed data. In this paper, we show the
prediction accuracy and uncertainty prediction results for various unknown
scenarios, including port navigation, zigzag, turning, and random control
maneuvers, assuming that only port navigation data is available. Furthermore,
this paper demonstrates the utility of the proposed method as a maneuvering
simulator for assessing heading-keeping PD control. As a result, it was
confirmed that the proposed method can achieve high accuracy if training data
with similar state distributions is provided, and that it can also predict high
uncertainty for states that deviate from the training data distribution. In the
performance evaluation of PD control, it was confirmed that considering
worst-case scenarios reduces the possibility of overestimating performance
compared to the true system. Finally, we show the results of applying the
proposed method to full-scale ship data, demonstrating its applicability to
full-scale ships.

                                        <span>  Despite recent advances in learning-based behavioral planning for autonomous
systems, decision-making in multi-task missions remains a challenging problem.
For instance, a mission might require a robot to explore an unknown
environment, locate the goals, and navigate to them, even if there are
obstacles along the way. Such problems are difficult to solve due to: a) sparse
rewards, meaning a reward signal is available only once all the tasks in a
mission have been satisfied, and b) the agent having to perform tasks at
run-time that are not covered in the training data, e.g., demonstrations only
from an environment where all doors were unlocked. Consequently,
state-of-the-art decision-making methods in such settings are limited to
missions where the required tasks are well-represented in the training
demonstrations and can be solved within a short planning horizon. To overcome
these limitations, we propose Adaptformer, a stochastic and adaptive planner
that utilizes sequence models for sample-efficient exploration and
exploitation. This framework relies on learning an energy-based heuristic,
which needs to be minimized over a sequence of high-level decisions. To
generate successful action sequences for long-horizon missions, Adaptformer
aims to achieve shorter sub-goals, which are proposed through an intrinsic
sub-goal curriculum. Through these two key components, Adaptformer allows for
generalization to out-of-distribution tasks and environments, i.e., missions
that were not a part of the training data. Empirical results in multiple
simulation environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably,
Adaptformer not only outperforms the state-of-the-art method by up to 25% in
multi-goal maze reachability tasks but also successfully adapts to multi-task
missions that the state-of-the-art method could not complete, leveraging
demonstrations from single-goal-reaching tasks.

represents a high-level abstraction of environments. However, constructing such
a map poses challenges related to the fusion of multi-modal sensor data, the
attainment of real-time mapping performance, and the preservation of structural
and semantic information consistency. In this paper, we introduce an online
metric-semantic mapping system that utilizes LiDAR-Visual-Inertial sensing to
generate a global metric-semantic mesh map of large-scale outdoor environments.
Leveraging GPU acceleration, our mapping process achieves exceptional speed,
with frame processing taking less than 7ms, regardless of scenario scale.
Furthermore, we seamlessly integrate the resultant map into a real-world
navigation system, enabling metric-semantic-based terrain assessment and
autonomous point-to-point navigation within a campus environment. Through
extensive experiments conducted on both publicly available and self-collected
datasets comprising 24 sequences, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
mapping and navigation methodologies. Code has been publicly released:

research, propelling its development towards intelligence and efficiency.
Currently, the development of AD technology follows two main technical paths:
modularization and end-to-end. Modularization decompose the driving task into
modules such as perception, prediction, planning, and control, and train them
separately. Due to the inconsistency of training objectives between modules,
the integrated effect suffers from bias. End-to-end attempts to address this
issue by utilizing a single model that directly maps from sensor data to
control signals. This path has limited learning capabilities in a comprehensive
set of features and struggles to handle unpredictable long-tail events and
complex urban traffic scenarios. In the face of challenges encountered in both
paths, many researchers believe that large language models (LLMs) with powerful
reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge understanding may be the
solution, expecting LLMs to provide AD systems with deeper levels of
understanding and decision-making capabilities. In light of the challenges
faced by both paths, many researchers believe that LLMs, with their powerful
reasoning abilities and extensive knowledge, could offer a solution. To
understand if LLMs could enhance AD, this paper conducts a thorough analysis of
the potential applications of LLMs in AD systems, including exploring their
optimization strategies in both modular and end-to-end approaches, with a
particular focus on how LLMs can tackle the problems and challenges present in
current solutions. Furthermore, we discuss an important question: Can LLM-based
artificial general intelligence (AGI) be a key to achieve high-level AD? We
further analyze the potential limitations and challenges that LLMs may
encounter in promoting the development of AD technology.

key-frame policy network for solving high-precision pick and place tasks.
Instead of learning actions directly, Imagination Policy generates point clouds
to imagine desired states which are then translated to actions using rigid
action estimation. This transforms action inference into a local generative
task. We leverage pick and place symmetries underlying the tasks in the
generation process and achieve extremely high sample efficiency and
generalizability to unseen configurations. Finally, we demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across various tasks on the RLbench benchmark

pose estimation. Leveraging zero-shot pose estimation, our approach enables the
robot to automatically obtain training data without manual labeling. After pose
estimation the object is grasped, and in-hand pose estimation is used for data
validation. Our pipeline allows the system to fine-tune while the process is
running, removing the need for a learning phase. The motivation behind our work
lies in the need for rapid setup of pose estimation solutions. Specifically, we
address the challenging task of bin picking, which plays a pivotal role in
flexible robotic setups. Our method is implemented on a robotics work-cell, and
tested with four different objects. For all objects, our method increases the
performance and outperforms a state-of-the-art method trained on the CAD model
of the objects.

                                        <span>  The control of legged robots, particularly humanoid and quadruped robots,
presents significant challenges due to their high-dimensional and nonlinear
dynamics. While linear systems can be effectively controlled using methods like
Model Predictive Control (MPC), the control of nonlinear systems remains
complex. One promising solution is the Koopman Operator, which approximates
nonlinear dynamics with a linear model, enabling the use of proven linear
control techniques. However, achieving accurate linearization through
data-driven methods is difficult due to issues like approximation error, domain
shifts, and the limitations of fixed linear state-space representations. These
challenges restrict the scalability of Koopman-based approaches. This paper
addresses these challenges by proposing a continual learning algorithm designed
to iteratively refine Koopman dynamics for high-dimensional legged robots. The
key idea is to progressively expand the dataset and latent space dimension,
enabling the learned Koopman dynamics to converge towards accurate
approximations of the true system dynamics. Theoretical analysis shows that the
linear approximation error of our method converges monotonically. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves high control performance on robots
like Unitree G1/H1/A1/Go2 and ANYmal D, across various terrains using simple
linear MPC controllers. This work is the first to successfully apply linearized
Koopman dynamics for locomotion control of high-dimensional legged robots,
enabling a scalable model-based control solution.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we introduce an algorithm designed to address the problem of
time-optimal formation reshaping in three-dimensional environments while
preventing collisions between agents. The utility of the proposed approach is
particularly evident in mobile robotics, where agents benefit from being
organized and navigated in formation for a variety of real-world applications
requiring frequent alterations in formation shape for efficient navigation or
task completion. Given the constrained operational time inherent to
battery-powered mobile robots, the time needed to complete the formation
reshaping process is crucial for their efficient operation, especially in case
of multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed Collision-Aware
Time-Optimal formation Reshaping Algorithm (CAT-ORA) builds upon the Hungarian
algorithm for the solution of the robot-to-goal assignment implementing the
inter-agent collision avoidance through direct constraints on mutually
exclusive robot-goal pairs combined with a trajectory generation approach
minimizing the duration of the reshaping process. Theoretical validations
confirm the optimality of CAT-ORA, with its efficacy further showcased through
simulations, and a real-world outdoor experiment involving 19 UAVs. Thorough
numerical analysis shows the potential of CAT-ORA to decrease the time required
to perform complex formation reshaping tasks by up to 49%, and 12% on average
compared to commonly used methods in randomly generated scenarios.

(LfD) model based on reservoir computing that can learn and generate multiple
movement trajectories with prediction intervals, which we call as Context-based
Echo State Network with prediction confidence (CESN+). CESN+ can generate
movement trajectories that may go beyond the initial LfD training based on a
desired set of conditions while providing confidence on its generated output.
To assess the abilities of CESN+, we first evaluate its performance against
Conditional Neural Movement Primitives (CNMP), a comparable framework that uses
a conditional neural process to generate movement primitives. Our findings
indicate that CESN+ not only outperforms CNMP but is also faster to train and
demonstrates impressive performance in generating trajectories for
extrapolation cases. In human-robot shared control applications, the confidence
of the machine generated trajectory is a key indicator of how to arbitrate
control sharing. To show the usability of the CESN+ for human-robot adaptive
shared control, we have designed a proof-of-concept human-robot shared control
task and tested its efficacy in adapting the sharing weight between the human
and the robot by comparing it to a fixed-weight control scheme. The simulation
experiments show that with CESN+ based adaptive sharing the total human load in
shared control can be significantly reduced. Overall, the developed CESN+ model
is a strong lightweight LfD system with desirable properties such fast training
and ability to extrapolate to the new task parameters while producing robust
prediction intervals for its output.

                                        <span>  Robotic manipulators are critical in many applications but are known to
degrade over time. This degradation is influenced by the nature of the tasks
performed by the robot. Tasks with higher severity, such as handling heavy
payloads, can accelerate the degradation process. One way this degradation is
reflected is in the position accuracy of the robot's end-effector. In this
paper, we present a prognostic modeling framework that predicts a robotic
manipulator's Remaining Useful Life (RUL) while accounting for the effects of
task severity. Our framework represents the robot's position accuracy as a
Brownian motion process with a random drift parameter that is influenced by
task severity. The dynamic nature of task severity is modeled using a
continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). To evaluate RUL, we discuss two approaches
-- (1) a novel closed-form expression for Remaining Lifetime Distribution
(RLD), and (2) Monte Carlo simulations, commonly used in prognostics
literature. Theoretical results establish the equivalence between these RUL
computation approaches. We validate our framework through experiments using two
distinct physics-based simulators for planar and spatial robot fleets. Our
findings show that robots in both fleets experience shorter RUL when handling a
higher proportion of high-severity tasks.

                                        <span>  The reliability of the electric grid has in recent years become a larger
concern for regulators, planners, and consumers due to several high-impact
outage events, as well as the potential for even more impactful events in the
future. These concerns are largely the result of decades-old resource adequacy
(RA) planning frameworks being insufficiently adapted to the current types of
uncertainty faced by planners, including many sources of deep uncertainty for
which probability distributions cannot be defensibly assigned. There are
emerging methodologies for dealing with these new types of uncertainty in RA
assessment and procurement frameworks, but their adoption has been hindered by
the lack of consistent understanding of terminology related to RA and the
related concept of resilience, as well as a lack of syntheses of such available
methodologies. Here we provide an overview of RA and its relationship to
resilience, a summary of available methods for dealing with emerging types of
uncertainty faced by RA assessment, and an an overview of procurement
methodologies for operationalizing RA in the context of these types of
uncertainty. This paper provides a synthesis and guide for both researchers and
practitioners seeking to navigate a new, much more uncertain era of power
system planning.

                                        <span>  The Sinusoidal Input Describing Function (SIDF) is an effective tool for
control system analysis and design, with its reliability directly impacting the
performance of the designed control systems. This study enhances the
reliability of SIDF analysis and the performance of closed-loop reset feedback
control systems, presenting two main contributions. First, it introduces a
method to identify frequency ranges where SIDF analysis becomes inaccurate.
Second, these identified ranges correlate with high-magnitude, high-order
harmonics that can degrade system performance. To address this, a shaped reset
control strategy is proposed, which incorporates a shaping filter to tune reset
actions and reduce high-order harmonics. Then, a frequency-domain design
procedure of a PID shaping filter in a reset control system is outlined as a
case study. The PID filter effectively reduces high-order harmonics and
resolves limit-cycle issues under step inputs. Finally, simulations and
experimental results on a precision motion stage validate the efficacy of the
proposed shaped reset control, showing enhanced SIDF analysis accuracy,
improved steady-state precision over linear and reset controllers, and
elimination of limit cycles under step inputs.

                                        <span>  Online model predictive control (MPC) for piecewise affine (PWA) systems
requires the online solution to an optimization problem that implicitly
optimizes over the switching sequence of PWA regions, for which the
computational burden can be prohibitive. Alternatively, the computation can be
moved offline using explicit MPC; however, the online memory requirements and
the offline computation can then become excessive. In this work we propose a
solution in between online and explicit MPC, addressing the above issues by
partially dividing the computation between online and offline. To solve the
underlying MPC problem, a policy, learned offline, specifies the sequence of
PWA regions that the dynamics must follow, thus reducing the complexity of the
remaining optimization problem that solves over only the continuous states and
control inputs. We provide a condition, verifiable during learning, that
guarantees feasibility of the learned policy's output, such that an optimal
continuous control input can always be found online. Furthermore, a method for
iteratively generating training data offline allows the feasible policy to be
learned efficiently, reducing the offline computational burden. A numerical
experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of the method compared to both online
and explicit MPC.

                                        <span>  In the field of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS), the accurate
modeling of ship maneuvering motion for harbor maneuvers is a crucial
technology. Non-parametric system identification (SI) methods, which do not
require prior knowledge of the target ship, have the potential to produce
accurate maneuvering models using observed data. However, the modeling accuracy
significantly depends on the distribution of the available data. To address
these issues, we propose a probabilistic prediction method of maneuvering
motion that incorporates ensemble learning into a non-parametric SI using
feedforward neural networks. This approach captures the epistemic uncertainty
caused by insufficient or unevenly distributed data. In this paper, we show the
prediction accuracy and uncertainty prediction results for various unknown
scenarios, including port navigation, zigzag, turning, and random control
maneuvers, assuming that only port navigation data is available. Furthermore,
this paper demonstrates the utility of the proposed method as a maneuvering
simulator for assessing heading-keeping PD control. As a result, it was
confirmed that the proposed method can achieve high accuracy if training data
with similar state distributions is provided, and that it can also predict high
uncertainty for states that deviate from the training data distribution. In the
performance evaluation of PD control, it was confirmed that considering
worst-case scenarios reduces the possibility of overestimating performance
compared to the true system. Finally, we show the results of applying the
proposed method to full-scale ship data, demonstrating its applicability to
full-scale ships.

research, propelling its development towards intelligence and efficiency.
Currently, the development of AD technology follows two main technical paths:
modularization and end-to-end. Modularization decompose the driving task into
modules such as perception, prediction, planning, and control, and train them
separately. Due to the inconsistency of training objectives between modules,
the integrated effect suffers from bias. End-to-end attempts to address this
issue by utilizing a single model that directly maps from sensor data to
control signals. This path has limited learning capabilities in a comprehensive
set of features and struggles to handle unpredictable long-tail events and
complex urban traffic scenarios. In the face of challenges encountered in both
paths, many researchers believe that large language models (LLMs) with powerful
reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge understanding may be the
solution, expecting LLMs to provide AD systems with deeper levels of
understanding and decision-making capabilities. In light of the challenges
faced by both paths, many researchers believe that LLMs, with their powerful
reasoning abilities and extensive knowledge, could offer a solution. To
understand if LLMs could enhance AD, this paper conducts a thorough analysis of
the potential applications of LLMs in AD systems, including exploring their
optimization strategies in both modular and end-to-end approaches, with a
particular focus on how LLMs can tackle the problems and challenges present in
current solutions. Furthermore, we discuss an important question: Can LLM-based
artificial general intelligence (AGI) be a key to achieve high-level AD? We
further analyze the potential limitations and challenges that LLMs may
encounter in promoting the development of AD technology.

assigns a constant competition weight to its initial opinion. In contrast, we
investigate the effect of diminishing competition on the convergence point and
speed of the FJ dynamics. We prove that, if the competition is uniform across
agents and vanishes asymptotically, the convergence point coincides with the
nominal consensus reached with no competition. However, the diminishing
competition slows down convergence according to its own rate of decay. We study
this phenomenon analytically and provide upper and lower bounds on the
convergence rate. Further, if competition is not uniform across agents, we show
that the convergence point may not coincide with the nominal consensus point.
Finally, we evaluate our analytical insights numerically.

                                        <span>  In this paper, an orthogonal mode decomposition method is proposed to
decompose ffnite length real signals on both the real and imaginary axes of the
complex plane. The interpolation function space of ffnite length discrete
signal is constructed, and the relationship between the dimensionality of the
interpolation function space and its subspaces and the band width of the
interpolation function is analyzed. It is proved that the intrinsic mode is
actually the narrow band signal whose intrinsic instantaneous frequency is
always positive (or always negative). Thus, the eigenmode decomposition problem
is transformed into the orthogonal projection problem of interpolation function
space to its low frequency subspace or narrow band subspace. Different from the
existing mode decomposition methods, the orthogonal modal decomposition is a
local time-frequency domain algorithm. Each operation extracts a speciffc mode.
The global decomposition results obtained under the precise deffnition of
eigenmodes have uniqueness and orthogonality. The computational complexity of
the orthogonal mode decomposition method is also much smaller than that of the
existing mode decomposition methods.

                                        <span>  Capacity sharing networks are typical heterogeneous communication networks
widely applied in information and communications technology (ICT) field. In
such networks, resources like bandwidth, spectrum, computation and storage are
shared among various communication services. Meanwhile, the issue of network
congestion is always a prominent challenge. To handle network congestion
essentially needs to solve the load balancing of networks. In this paper, for
capacity sharing networks, we formulate their load balancing problem as a
maximum multi-commodity flow problem. For such a problem, always a large-scale
linear programming, the column generation algorithm is a commonly used and
crucial method to solve it. In each iteration, this algorithm involves solving
a linear programming subproblem and determining whether to terminate or
generate a new column for inclusion in the subproblem. This iterative procedure
of solving and checking continues throughout the algorithm. Nevertheless, since
the checking subproblem is NP-hard, its solution significantly impacts the
overall efficiency of the algorithm. In this paper, we innovatively convert the
checking subproblem into a single-constrained shortest path (SCSP) subproblem.
By exactly solving the SCSP subproblem, we can obtain the optimal solution to
the checking subproblem with same or less computing time. Experimental results
demonstrate that our algorithm achieves computational efficiency comparable to
heuristic algorithms while outperforming other state-of-the-art algorithms by
at least an order of magnitude.

                                        <span>  The transition towards the sixth-generation (6G) wireless telecommunications
networks introduces significant challenges for researchers and industry
stakeholders. The 6G technology aims to enhance existing usage scenarios
through supporting innovative applications that require stringent key
performance indicators (KPIs). In some critical use cases of 6G, multiple KPIs,
including immersive throughput, with an envisioned peak data rate of $1$ Tbps,
hyper-reliability, in the range of $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-7}$, and hyper
low-latency, between $0.1$ and $1$ ms, must be achieved simultaneously to
deliver the expected service experience. However, this is challenging due to
the conflicting nature of these KPIs. This article proposes a new service class
of 6G as immersive, hyper reliable, and low-latency communication (IHRLLC), and
introduces a potential network architecture to achieve the associated KPIs.
Specifically, enhanced technologies, such as ultra-massive multiple-input
multiple-output (umMIMO)-aided terahertz (THz) communications, reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RIS), and non-terrestrial networks (NTN), are viewed as
the key enablers for achieving immersive data rates and hyper reliability.
Given the computational complexity involved in employing these technologies, we
propose mathematical and computational enabling technologies, such as
learn-to-optimize (L2O), generative-AI (GenAI), quantum computing, and network
digital twin (NDT), to complement the proposed architecture and optimize the
latency.

distribution to a target probability distribution through a deterministic or
stochastic linear control system. Our proposed approach is inspired by the flow
matching methodology, with the difference that we can only affect the flow
through the given control channels. The motivation comes from applications such
as robotic swarms and stochastic thermodynamics, where agents or particles can
only be manipulated through control actions. The feedback control law that
achieves the task is characterized as the conditional expectation of the
control inputs for the stochastic bridges that respect the given control system
dynamics. Explicit forms are derived for special cases, and a numerical
procedure is presented to approximate the control law, illustrated with
examples.

More specifically, we develop a family of primal-dual proximal bundle methods
for solving convex nonsmooth composite optimization problems and establish the
iteration-complexity in terms of a primal-dual gap. We also propose a class of
proximal bundle methods for solving convex-concave composite saddle-point
problems and establish the iteration-complexity to find an approximate

of the proximal bundle method. In particular, we discover an interesting

                                        <span>  The classical Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality theorem establishes a
significant connection between Monge optimal transport and the maximization of
a linear form on the set of 1-Lipschitz functions. This result has been widely
used in various research areas, in particular, to expose the bridge between
Monge transport theory and a class of optimal design problems. The aim of this
paper is to present a similar theory when the linear form is maximized over
real $C^{1,1}$ functions whose Hessian is between minus and plus identity
matrix. It turns out that this problem can be viewed as the dual of a specific
optimal transport problem. The task is to find a minimal three-point plan with
the fixed first two marginals, while the third one must be larger than the
other two in the sense of convex order. The existence of optimal plans allows
to express solutions of the underlying Beckmann problem as a combination of
rank-one tensor measures supported by a graph. In the context of
two-dimensional mechanics, this graph encodes the optimal configuration of a
grillage that transfers a given load system.

                                        <span>  The Circumcentered Reflection Method (CRM) is a recently developed projection
method for solving convex feasibility problems. It offers preferable
convergence properties compared to classic methods such as the Douglas-Rachford
and the alternating projections method. In this study, our first main theorem
establishes that CRM can identify a feasible point in the intersection of two
closed convex cones in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) from any starting point in the
Euclidean plane. We then apply this theorem to intersections of two polyhedral
sets in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) and two wedge-like sets in \(\mathbb{R}^n\), proving
that CRM converges to a point in the intersection from any initial position
finitely. Additionally, we introduce a modified technique based on CRM, called
the Sphere-Centered Reflection Method. With the help of this technique, we
demonstrate that CRM can locate a feasible point in finitely many iterations in
the intersection of two proper polyhedral cones in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) when the
initial point lies in a subset of the complement of the intersection's polar
cone. Lastly, we provide an example illustrating that finite convergence may
fail for the intersection of two proper polyhedral cones in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) if
the initial guess is outside the designated set.

scenarios, namely (1) creating personal sound zones inside a bounded domain and
(2) shielded localized communication. Our strategy is based on the authors'
previous works establishing the possibility and stability of controlling
acoustic fields using an array of almost non-radiating coupling sources and
presents a detailed Fourier synthesis approach towards a time-domain effect. We
require that the array of acoustic sources creates the desired fields on the
control regions while maintaining a zero field beyond a larger circumscribed
sphere. This paper recalls the main theoretical results then presents the
underlying Fourier synthesis paradigm and show, through relevant simulations,
the performance of our strategy.

                                        <span>  Emerging geopolitical risks have begun to threaten global supply chains,
including those that produce life-saving drugs. Export bans may prevent a
company from shipping products internationally, and it is unclear how these new
dynamics may affect company plans and persistent, worldwide drug shortages. To
address these questions, we present a global pharmaceutical supply chain design
model that considers the risk of export bans that are induced by supplier
capacity disruptions and corresponding price increases. The model takes the
company's perspective as a decision-maker looking to locate plants and
distribute drugs globally. It is a two-stage stochastic program that includes
uncertainty in capacity, ability-to-export, and demand. The model is solved by
integrating the Sample Average Approximation and L-shaped methods. We present
conditions related to when demand will be met and a case study of a generic
oncology drug. We find that preparing for geopolitical strain may increase
resilience and profits as well as reduce shortages in the short term. At
baseline, expected global shortages are high (17.2%) with disparities across
country income levels (0.3%, 0.8%, 87.2%, and 87.6% for high, upper-middle,
lower-middle, and low income countries, respectively). Pricing policies may
improve drug access overall, back-shoring may slightly improve access for the
country where it is implemented, and bilateral alliances may not be effective
at improving access.

and semidefinite programming under a constant rank condition. Mathematical
Programming, 2023. DOI: 10.1007/s10107-023-01942-8] we introduced a constant
rank constraint qualification for nonlinear semidefinite and second-order cone
programming by considering all faces of the underlying cone. This condition is
independent of Robinson's condition and it implies a strong second-order
necessary optimality condition which depends on a single Lagrange multiplier
instead of the full set of Lagrange multipliers. In this paper we expand on
this result in several directions, namely, we consider the larger class of
$\mathcal{C}^2-$cone reducible constraints and we show that it is not necessary
to consider all faces of the cone; instead a single specific face should be
considered (which turns out to be weaker than Robinson's condition) in order
for the first order necessary optimality condition to hold. This gives rise to
a notion of facial reduction for nonlinear conic programming, that allows
locally redefining the original problem only in terms of this specific face
instead of the whole cone, providing a more robust formulation of the problem
in which Robinson's condition holds. We were also able to prove the strong
second-order necessary optimality condition in this context by considering only
the subfaces of this particular face, which is a new result even in nonlinear
programming.

                                        <span>  Capacity sharing networks are typical heterogeneous communication networks
widely applied in information and communications technology (ICT) field. In
such networks, resources like bandwidth, spectrum, computation and storage are
shared among various communication services. Meanwhile, the issue of network
congestion is always a prominent challenge. To handle network congestion
essentially needs to solve the load balancing of networks. In this paper, for
capacity sharing networks, we formulate their load balancing problem as a
maximum multi-commodity flow problem. For such a problem, always a large-scale
linear programming, the column generation algorithm is a commonly used and
crucial method to solve it. In each iteration, this algorithm involves solving
a linear programming subproblem and determining whether to terminate or
generate a new column for inclusion in the subproblem. This iterative procedure
of solving and checking continues throughout the algorithm. Nevertheless, since
the checking subproblem is NP-hard, its solution significantly impacts the
overall efficiency of the algorithm. In this paper, we innovatively convert the
checking subproblem into a single-constrained shortest path (SCSP) subproblem.
By exactly solving the SCSP subproblem, we can obtain the optimal solution to
the checking subproblem with same or less computing time. Experimental results
demonstrate that our algorithm achieves computational efficiency comparable to
heuristic algorithms while outperforming other state-of-the-art algorithms by
at least an order of magnitude.

                                        <span>  Bilevel optimization, the problem of minimizing a value function which
involves the arg-minimum of another function, appears in many areas of machine
learning. In a large scale empirical risk minimization setting where the number
of samples is huge, it is crucial to develop stochastic methods, which only use
a few samples at a time to progress. However, computing the gradient of the
value function involves solving a linear system, which makes it difficult to
derive unbiased stochastic estimates. To overcome this problem we introduce a
novel framework, in which the solution of the inner problem, the solution of
the linear system, and the main variable evolve at the same time. These
directions are written as a sum, making it straightforward to derive unbiased
estimates. The simplicity of our approach allows us to develop global variance
reduction algorithms, where the dynamics of all variables is subject to
variance reduction. We demonstrate that SABA, an adaptation of the celebrated
SAGA algorithm in our framework, has $O(\frac1T)$ convergence rate, and that it
achieves linear convergence under Polyak-Lojasciewicz assumption. This is the
first stochastic algorithm for bilevel optimization that verifies either of
these properties. Numerical experiments validate the usefulness of our method.

                                        <span>  Bilevel optimization problems, which are problems where two optimization
problems are nested, have more and more applications in machine learning. In
many practical cases, the upper and the lower objectives correspond to
empirical risk minimization problems and therefore have a sum structure. In
this context, we propose a bilevel extension of the celebrated SARAH algorithm.
We demonstrate that the algorithm requires
$\mathcal{O}((n+m)^{\frac12}\varepsilon^{-1})$ oracle calls to achieve
$\varepsilon$-stationarity with $n+m$ the total number of samples, which
improves over all previous bilevel algorithms. Moreover, we provide a lower
bound on the number of oracle calls required to get an approximate stationary
point of the objective function of the bilevel problem. This lower bound is
attained by our algorithm, making it optimal in terms of sample complexity.

                                        <span>  Rigid multi-link robotic arms face a tradeoff between their overall reach
distance (the workspace), and how compactly they can be collapsed (the storage
volume). Increasing the workspace of a robot arm requires longer links, which
adds weight to the system and requires a larger storage volume. However, the
tradeoff between workspace and storage volume can be resolved by the use of
deployable structures with high extensibility. In this work we introduce a
bidirectional tape spring based structure that can be stored in a compact state
and then extended to perform manipulation tasks, allowing for a large
manipulation workspace and low storage volume. Bidirectional tape springs are
demonstrated to have large buckling strength compared to single tape springs,
while maintaining the ability to roll into a compact storage volume. Two tape
spring structures are integrated into a bimanual manipulator robot called
GRIP-tape that allows for object Grasping and Rolling In Planar configurations
(GRIP). In demonstrations we show that the continuum kinematics of the tape
springs enable novel manipulation capabilities such as simultaneous
translation-rotation and multi-object conveyance. Furthermore, the dual
mechanical properties of stiffness and softness in the tape springs enables
inherent safety from unintended collisions within the workspace and
soft-contact with objects. Our system demonstrates new opportunities for
extensible manipulators that may benefit manipulation in remote environments
such as space and the deep sea.

in novel environments. However, existing methods that leverage differentiable
simulators to identify world models are incapable of jointly optimizing the
shape, appearance, and physical properties of the scene. In this work, we
introduce a novel object representation that allows the joint identification of
these properties. Our method employs a novel differentiable point-based object

differentiable object collision detection and rendering. Combined with a
differentiable physical simulator, we achieve end-to-end optimization of world

simulated and real environments, we show that our method can learn both

dissipativity constraints on the controller for closed-loop stability. The
constraints are formulated as a set of linear inequalities in the frequency
domain. This leads to a convex problem that is scalable with respect to the
length of the data and the complexity of the controller. An extension of
virtual reference feedback tuning to include disturbance dynamics is also
discussed. The proposed data-driven control design is illustrated by a soft

paradigm, necessitating the collection of task data in an end-to-end manner.
Consequently, the learned policy tends to fail to tackle novel tasks. Moreover,
it is hard to localize the errors for a complex task with multiple stages due
to end-to-end learning. To address these challenges, we propose RoboMatrix, a
skill-centric and hierarchical framework for scalable task planning and
execution. We first introduce a novel skill-centric paradigm that extracts the
common meta-skills from different complex tasks. This allows for the capture of
embodied demonstrations through a kill-centric approach, enabling the
completion of open-world tasks by combining learned meta-skills. To fully
leverage meta-skills, we further develop a hierarchical framework that
decouples complex robot tasks into three interconnected layers: (1) a
high-level modular scheduling layer; (2) a middle-level skill layer; and (3) a
low-level hardware layer. Experimental results illustrate that our
skill-centric and hierarchical framework achieves remarkable generalization
performance across novel objects, scenes, tasks, and embodiments. This
framework offers a novel solution for robot task planning and execution in
open-world scenarios. Our software and hardware are available at

                                        <span>  Ensuring safety via safety filters in real-world robotics presents
significant challenges, particularly when the system dynamics is complex or
unavailable. To handle this issue, learning-based safety filters recently
gained popularity, which can be classified as model-based and model-free
methods. Existing model-based approaches requires various assumptions on system
model (e.g., control-affine), which limits their application in complex
systems, and existing model-free approaches need substantial modifications to
standard RL algorithms and lack versatility. This paper proposes a simple,
plugin-and-play, and effective model-free safety filter learning framework. We
introduce a novel reward formulation and use Q-learning to learn Q-value
functions to safeguard arbitrary task specific nominal policies via filtering
out their potentially unsafe actions. The threshold used in the filtering
process is supported by our theoretical analysis. Due to its model-free nature
and simplicity, our framework can be seamlessly integrated with various RL
algorithms. We validate the proposed approach through simulations on double
integrator and Dubin's car systems and demonstrate its effectiveness in
real-world experiments with a soft robotic limb.

                                        <span>  Designs incorporating kinematic loops are becoming increasingly prevalent in
the robotics community. Despite the existence of dynamics algorithms to deal
with the effects of such loops, many modern simulators rely on dynamics
libraries that require robots to be represented as kinematic trees. This
requirement is reflected in the de facto standard format for describing robots,
the Universal Robot Description Format (URDF), which does not support kinematic
loops resulting in closed chains. This paper introduces an enhanced URDF,
termed URDF+, which addresses this key shortcoming of URDF while retaining the
intuitive design philosophy and low barrier to entry that the robotics
community values. The URDF+ keeps the elements used by URDF to describe open
chains and incorporates new elements to encode loop joints. We also offer an
accompanying parser that processes the system models coming from URDF+ so that
they can be used with recursive rigid-body dynamics algorithms for closed-chain
systems that group bodies into local, decoupled loops. This parsing process is
fully automated, ensuring optimal grouping of constrained bodies without
requiring manual specification from the user. We aim to advance the robotics
community towards this elegant solution by developing efficient and easy-to-use
software tools.

                                        <span>  Trajectory prediction is essential for the safety and efficiency of planning
in autonomous vehicles. However, current models often fail to fully capture
complex traffic rules and the complete range of potential vehicle movements.
Addressing these limitations, this study introduces three novel loss functions:
Offroad Loss, Direction Consistency Error, and Diversity Loss. These functions
are designed to keep predicted paths within driving area boundaries, aligned
with traffic directions, and cover a wider variety of plausible driving
scenarios. As all prediction modes should adhere to road rules and conditions,
this work overcomes the shortcomings of traditional "winner takes all" training
methods by applying the loss functions to all prediction modes. These loss
functions not only improve model training but can also serve as metrics for
evaluating the realism and diversity of trajectory predictions. Extensive
validation on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets with leading baseline
models demonstrates that our approach not only maintains accuracy but
significantly improves safety and robustness, reducing offroad errors on
average by 47% on original and by 37% on attacked scenes. This work sets a new
benchmark for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, offering substantial
improvements in navigating complex environments. Our code is available at

Simulation-to-real transfer offers a promising approach to address this
challenge in robotics. While differentiable simulators offer improved sample
efficiency through exact gradients, they can be unstable in contact-rich
environments and may lead to poor generalization. This paper introduces a novel
approach integrating sharpness-aware optimization into gradient-based
reinforcement learning algorithms. Our simulation results demonstrate that our
method, tested on contact-rich environments, significantly enhances policy
robustness to environmental variations and action perturbations while
maintaining the sample efficiency of first-order methods. Specifically, our
approach improves action noise tolerance compared to standard first-order
methods and achieves generalization comparable to zeroth-order methods. This
improvement stems from finding flatter minima in the loss landscape, associated
with better generalization. Our work offers a promising solution to balance
efficient learning and robust sim-to-real transfer in robotics, potentially
bridging the gap between simulation and real-world performance.

                                        <span>  Self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) has gained popularity for
obtaining depth predictions directly from videos. However, these methods often
produce scale invariant results, unless additional training signals are
provided. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a novel self-supervised
metric-scaled MDE model that requires only monocular video data and the
camera's mounting position, both of which are readily available in modern
vehicles. Our approach leverages planar-parallax geometry to reconstruct scene
structure. The full pipeline consists of three main networks, a multi-frame
network, a singleframe network, and a pose network. The multi-frame network
processes sequential frames to estimate the structure of the static scene using
planar-parallax geometry and the camera mounting position. Based on this
reconstruction, it acts as a teacher, distilling knowledge such as scale
information, masked drivable area, metric-scale depth for the static scene, and
dynamic object mask to the singleframe network. It also aids the pose network
in predicting a metric-scaled relative pose between two subsequent images. Our
method achieved state-of-the-art results for the driving benchmark KITTI for
metric-scaled depth prediction. Notably, it is one of the first methods to
produce self-supervised metric-scaled depth prediction for the challenging
Cityscapes dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

                                        <span>  The advancement of large Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models has
significantly improved robotic manipulation in terms of language-guided task
execution and generalization to unseen scenarios. While existing VLAs adapted
from pretrained large Vision-Language-Models (VLM) have demonstrated promising
generalizability, their task performance is still unsatisfactory as indicated
by the low tasks success rates in different environments. In this paper, we
present a new advanced VLA architecture derived from VLM. Unlike previous works
that directly repurpose VLM for action prediction by simple action
quantization, we propose a omponentized VLA architecture that has a specialized
action module conditioned on VLM output. We systematically study the design of
the action module and demonstrates the strong performance enhancement with
diffusion action transformers for action sequence modeling, as well as their
favorable scaling behaviors. We also conduct comprehensive experiments and
ablation studies to evaluate the efficacy of our models with varied designs.
The evaluation on 5 robot embodiments in simulation and real work shows that
our model not only significantly surpasses existing VLAs in task performance
and but also exhibits remarkable adaptation to new robots and generalization to
unseen objects and backgrounds. It exceeds the average success rates of OpenVLA
which has similar model size (7B) with ours by over 35% in simulated evaluation
and 55% in real robot experiments. It also outperforms the large RT-2-X model
(55B) by 18% absolute success rates in simulation. Code and models can be found

                                        <span>  Planning safe and efficient trajectories through signal-free intersections
presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in
dynamic, multi-task environments with unpredictable interactions and an
increased possibility of conflicts. This study aims to address these challenges
by developing a robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety in such complex
scenarios. Existing approaches often struggle to provide reliable safety
mechanisms in dynamic and learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in
signal-free intersections. This study proposes a safety-critical planning
method that integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF)
with a diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser
(DSC-Diffuser), offering a robust solution for adaptive, safe, and multi-task
driving in signal-free intersections. Our approach incorporates a
goal-oriented, task-guided diffusion model, enabling the model to learn
multiple driving tasks simultaneously from real-world data. To further ensure
driving safety in dynamic environments, the proposed DHOCBF framework
dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of surrounding vehicles,
offering enhanced adaptability compared to traditional control barrier
functions. Validity evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical
simulations, demonstrate its robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle
velocities, sizes, uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining
driving safety across a wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios.
Performance evaluations across various scenes confirm that DSC-Diffuser
provides realistic, stable, and generalizable policies, equipping it with the
flexibility to adapt to diverse driving tasks.

HRI framework for estimating the Robot Trust towards the Human in the context
of a narrow and specified task. The framework produces a real-time estimation
of an AI agent's Artificial Trust towards a Human partner interacting with a
mobile teleoperation robot. The approach for the framework is based on
principles drawn from Theory of Mind, including information about the human
state, action, and intent. The framework creates the ATTUNE model for
Artificial Trust Towards Human Operators. The model uses metrics on the
operator's state of attention, navigational intent, actions, and performance to
quantify the Trust towards them. The model is tested on a pre-existing dataset
that includes recordings (ROSbags) of a human trial in a simulated disaster
response scenario. The performance of ATTUNE is evaluated through a qualitative
and quantitative analysis. The results of the analyses provide insight into the
next stages of the research and help refine the proposed approach.

demand for scenario-based testing to simulate diverse driving scenarios.
However, as the base of any driving scenarios, road scenarios (e.g., road
topology and geometry) have received little attention by the literature.
Despite several advances, they either generate basic road components without a
complete road network, or generate a complete road network but with simple road
components. The resulting road scenarios lack diversity in both topology and
geometry. To address this problem, we propose RoadGen to systematically
generate diverse road scenarios. The key idea is to connect eight types of
parameterized road components to form road scenarios with high diversity in
topology and geometry. Our evaluation has demonstrated the effectiveness and
usefulness of RoadGen in generating diverse road scenarios for simulation.

                                        <span>  Recently, there has been a significant escalation in both academic and
industrial commitment towards the development of autonomous driving systems
(ADSs). A number of simulation testing approaches have been proposed to
generate diverse driving scenarios for ADS testing. However, scenarios
generated by these previous approaches are static and lack interactions between
the EGO vehicle and the NPC vehicles, resulting in a large amount of time on
average to find violation scenarios. Besides, a large number of the violations
they found are caused by aggressive behaviors of NPC vehicles, revealing none
bugs of ADS.
  In this work, we propose the concept of adversarial NPC vehicles and
introduce AdvFuzz, a novel simulation testing approach, to generate adversarial
scenarios on main lanes (e.g., urban roads and highways). AdvFuzz allows NPC
vehicles to dynamically interact with the EGO vehicle and regulates the
behaviors of NPC vehicles, finding more violation scenarios caused by the EGO
vehicle more quickly. We compare AdvFuzz with a random approach and three
state-of-the-art scenario-based testing approaches. Our experiments demonstrate
that AdvFuzz can generate 198.34% more violation scenarios compared to the
other four approaches in 12 hours and increase the proportion of violations
caused by the EGO vehicle to 87.04%, which is more than 7 times that of other
approaches. Additionally, AdvFuzz is at least 92.21% faster in finding one
violation caused by the EGO vehicle than that of the other approaches.

                                        <span>  Closed-loop simulation is crucial for end-to-end autonomous driving. Existing
sensor simulation methods (e.g., NeRF and 3DGS) reconstruct driving scenes
based on conditions that closely mirror training data distributions. However,
these methods struggle with rendering novel trajectories, such as lane changes.
Recent works have demonstrated that integrating world model knowledge
alleviates these issues. Despite their efficiency, these approaches still
encounter difficulties in the accurate representation of more complex
maneuvers, with multi-lane shifts being a notable example. Therefore, we
introduce ReconDreamer, which enhances driving scene reconstruction through
incremental integration of world model knowledge. Specifically, DriveRestorer
is proposed to mitigate artifacts via online restoration. This is complemented
by a progressive data update strategy designed to ensure high-quality rendering
for more complex maneuvers. To the best of our knowledge, ReconDreamer is the
first method to effectively render in large maneuvers. Experimental results
demonstrate that ReconDreamer outperforms Street Gaussians in the NTA-IoU,
NTL-IoU, and FID, with relative improvements by 24.87%, 6.72%, and 29.97%.
Furthermore, ReconDreamer surpasses DriveDreamer4D with PVG during large
maneuver rendering, as verified by a relative improvement of 195.87% in the
NTA-IoU metric and a comprehensive user study.

                                        <span>  The ultrasound scanning robot operates in environments where frequent
human-robot interactions occur. Most existing control methods for ultrasound
scanning address only one specific interaction situation or implement hard
switches between controllers for different situations, which compromises both
safety and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified interaction control
framework for ultrasound scanning robots capable of handling all common
interactions, distinguishing both human-intended and unintended types, and
adapting with appropriate compliance. Specifically, the robot suspends or
modulates its ongoing main task if the interaction is intended, e.g., when the
doctor grasps the robot to lead the end effector actively. Furthermore, it can
identify unintended interactions and avoid potential collision in the null
space beforehand. Even if that collision has happened, it can become compliant
with the collision in the null space and try to reduce its impact on the main
task (where the scan is ongoing) kinematically and dynamically. The multiple
situations are integrated into a unified controller with a smooth transition to
deal with the interactions by exhibiting human-intention-aware compliance.
Experimental results validate the framework's ability to cope with all common
interactions including intended intervention and unintended collision in a
collaborative carotid artery ultrasound scanning task.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we explore how to optimize task allocation for robot swarms in
dynamic environments, emphasizing the necessity of formulating robust,
flexible, and scalable strategies for robot cooperation. We introduce a novel
framework using a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process
(Dec_POMDP), specifically designed for distributed robot swarm networks. At the
core of our methodology is the Local Information Aggregation Multi-Agent Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (LIA_MADDPG) algorithm, which merges centralized
training with distributed execution (CTDE). During the centralized training
phase, a local information aggregation (LIA) module is meticulously designed to
gather critical data from neighboring robots, enhancing decision-making
efficiency. In the distributed execution phase, a strategy improvement method
is proposed to dynamically adjust task allocation based on changing and
partially observable environmental conditions. Our empirical evaluations show
that the LIA module can be seamlessly integrated into various CTDE-based MARL
methods, significantly enhancing their performance. Additionally, by comparing
LIA_MADDPG with six conventional reinforcement learning algorithms and a
heuristic algorithm, we demonstrate its superior scalability, rapid adaptation
to environmental changes, and ability to maintain both stability and
convergence speed. These results underscore LIA_MADDPG's outstanding
performance and its potential to significantly improve dynamic task allocation
in robot swarms through enhanced local collaboration and adaptive strategy
execution.

                                        <span>  The autonomous learning of new goals in robotics remains a complex issue to
address. Here, we propose a model where curiosity influence learning
flexibility. To do so, this paper proposes to root curiosity and attention
together by taking inspiration from the Locus Coeruleus-Norepinephrine system
along with various cognitive processes such as cognitive persistence and visual
habituation. We apply our approach by experimenting with a simulated robotic
arm on a set of objects with varying difficulty. The robot first discovers new
goals via bottom-up attention through motor babbling with an inhibition of
return mechanism, then engage to the learning of goals due to neural activity
arising within the curiosity mechanism. The architecture is modelled with
dynamic neural fields and the learning of goals such as pushing the objects in
diverse directions is supported by the use of forward and inverse models
implemented by multi-layer perceptrons. The adoption of dynamic neural fields
to model curiosity, habituation and persistence allows the robot to demonstrate
various learning trajectories depending on the object. In addition, the
approach exhibits interesting properties regarding the learning of similar
goals as well as the continuous switch between exploration and exploitation.

Obstacles), a novel method that ensures socially appropriate behavior by
dynamically grouping obstacles and adhering to social norms. Using deep
reinforcement learning, SANGO trains agents to navigate complex environments
leveraging the DBSCAN algorithm for obstacle clustering and Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) for path planning. The proposed approach improves safety and
social compliance by maintaining appropriate distances and reducing collision
rates. Extensive experiments conducted in custom simulation environments
demonstrate SANGO's superior performance in significantly reducing discomfort
(by up to 83.5%), reducing collision rates (by up to 29.4%) and achieving
higher successful navigation in dynamic and crowded scenarios. These findings
highlight the potential of SANGO for real-world applications, paving the way
for advanced socially adept robotic navigation systems.

handle unforeseen contact with environment without penetrating into soft, i.e.
viscoelastic, materials or even damaging brittle or fragile materials. Robotics
and mechatronics with tactile and haptic capabilities, and medical assistance
systems in particular, place special demands on the advanced motion control
systems that should enable safe and harmless contact transitions. This paper
demonstrates how the fundamental principles of loop shaping can easily be used
to handle the sufficiently stiff motion control with a sensor-free dynamic
extension to reconfigure at contact with environment. Hybrid control scheme is
proposed. Remarkable feature of the developed approach is that no measurement
of the contact force is required and the input signal and measured output
displacement are the only quantities used for control design and operation.
Experimental scenarios for 1DOF actuator are shown where the moving tool comes
into contact with grape fruits that are soft and penetrable at the same time.

                                        <span>  Constructing 3D representations of object geometry is critical for many
downstream manipulation tasks. These representations must be built from
potentially noisy partial observations. In this work we focus on the problem of
reconstructing a multi-object scene from a single RGBD image. Current deep
learning approaches to this problem can be brittle to noisy real world
observations and out-of-distribution objects. Other approaches that do not rely
on training data cannot accurately infer the backside of objects. We propose
BRRP, a reconstruction method that can leverage preexisting mesh datasets to
build an informative prior during robust probabilistic reconstruction. In order
to make our method more efficient, we introduce the concept of
retrieval-augmented prior, where we retrieve relevant components of our prior
distribution during inference. Our method produces a distribution over object
shape that can be used for reconstruction or measuring uncertainty. We evaluate
our method in both procedurally generated scenes and in real world scenes. We
show our method is more robust than a deep learning approach while being more
accurate than a method with an uninformative prior.

                                        <span>  In recent years, labor shortages due to the declining birthrate and aging
population have become significant challenges at construction sites in
developed countries, including Japan. To address these challenges, we are
developing an open platform called ROS2-TMS for Construction, a Cyber-Physical
System (CPS) for construction sites, to achieve both efficiency and safety in
earthwork operations. In ROS2-TMS for Construction, the system comprehensively
collects and stores environmental information from sensors placed throughout
the construction site. Based on these data, a real-time virtual construction
site is created in cyberspace. Then, based on the state of construction
machinery and environmental conditions in cyberspace, the optimal next actions
for actual construction machinery are determined, and the construction
machinery is operated accordingly. In this project, we decided to use the Open
Platform for Earthwork with Robotics and Autonomy (OPERA), developed by the
Public Works Research Institute (PWRI) in Japan, to control construction
machinery from ROS2-TMS for Construction with an originally extended behavior
tree. In this study, we present an overview of OPERA, focusing on the newly
developed navigation package for operating the crawler dump, as well as the
overall structure of ROS2-TMS for Construction as a Cyber-Physical System
(CPS). Additionally, we conducted experiments using a crawler dump and a
backhoe to verify the aforementioned functionalities.

                                        <span>  Aligning human preference and value is an important requirement for building
contemporary foundation models and embodied AI. However, popular approaches
such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) break down the task
into successive stages, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modeling
(RM), and reinforcement learning (RL), each performing one specific learning
task. Such a sequential approach results in serious issues such as significant
under-utilization of data and distribution mismatch between the learned reward
model and generated policy, which eventually lead to poor alignment
performance. We develop a single stage approach named Alignment with Integrated
Human Feedback (AIHF), capable of integrating both human preference and
demonstration to train reward models and the policy. The proposed approach
admits a suite of efficient algorithms, which can easily reduce to, and
leverage, popular alignment algorithms such as RLHF and Directly Policy
Optimization (DPO), and only requires minor changes to the existing alignment
pipelines. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solutions with
extensive experiments involving alignment problems in LLMs and robotic control
problems in MuJoCo. We observe that the proposed solutions outperform the
existing alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO by large margins, especially
when the amount of high-quality preference data is relatively limited.

                                        <span>  Camera relocalization methods range from dense image alignment to direct
camera pose regression from a query image. Among these, sparse feature matching
stands out as an efficient, versatile, and generally lightweight approach with
numerous applications. However, feature-based methods often struggle with
significant viewpoint and appearance changes, leading to matching failures and
inaccurate pose estimates. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel
approach that leverages a globally sparse yet locally dense 3D representation
of 2D features. By tracking and triangulating landmarks over a sequence of
frames, we construct a sparse voxel map optimized to render image patch
descriptors observed during tracking. Given an initial pose estimate, we first
synthesize descriptors from the voxels using volumetric rendering and then
perform feature matching to estimate the camera pose. This methodology enables
the generation of descriptors for unseen views, enhancing robustness to view
changes. We extensively evaluate our method on the 7-Scenes and Cambridge
Landmarks datasets. Our results show that our method significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art feature representation techniques in indoor
environments, achieving up to a 39% improvement in median translation error.
Additionally, our approach yields comparable results to other methods for
outdoor scenarios while maintaining lower memory and computational costs.

Control algorithm, which uses an ensemble of learned models for prediction,
with a runtime monitor to flag unreliable out-of-distribution (OOD)
predictions. When an OOD situation is detected, SODA-MPC triggers a safe
fallback control strategy based on reachability, yielding a control framework
that achieves the high performance of learning-based models while preserving
the safety of reachability-based control. We demonstrate the method in the
context of an autonomous vehicle, driving among dynamic pedestrians, where
SODA-MPC uses a neural network ensemble for pedestrian prediction. We calibrate
the OOD signal using conformal prediction to derive an OOD detector with
probabilistic guarantees on the false-positive rate, given a user-specified
confidence level. During in-distribution operation, the MPC controller avoids
collisions with a pedestrian based on the trajectory predicted by the mean of
the ensemble. When OOD conditions are detected, the MPC switches to a
reachability-based controller to avoid collisions with the reachable set of the
pedestrian assuming a maximum pedestrian speed, to guarantee safety under the
worst-case actions of the pedestrian. We verify SODA-MPC in extensive
autonomous driving simulations in a pedestrian-crossing scenario. Our model
ensemble is trained and calibrated with real pedestrian data, showing that our
OOD detector obtains the desired accuracy rate within a theoretically-predicted
range. We empirically show improved safety and improved task completion
compared with two state-of-the-art MPC methods that also use conformal
prediction, but without OOD adaptation. Further, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method with the large-scale multi-agent predictor
Trajectron++, using large-scale traffic data from the nuScenes dataset for
training and calibration.

often involve both continuous states and discrete switchings. Safety is a
primary concern for hybrid robotic systems. Existing safety-critical control
approaches for hybrid systems are either computationally inefficient,
detrimental to system performance, or limited to small-scale systems. To amend
these drawbacks, in this paper, we propose a learning-enabled approach to
construct local Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee the safety of a
wide class of nonlinear hybrid dynamical systems. The end result is a safe
neural CBF-based switching controller. Our approach is computationally
efficient, minimally invasive to any reference controller, and applicable to
large-scale systems. We empirically evaluate our framework and demonstrate its
efficacy and flexibility through two robotic examples including a
high-dimensional autonomous racing case, against other CBF-based approaches and
model predictive control.

                                        <span>  To efficiently deploy robotic systems in society, mobile robots need to
autonomously and safely move through complex environments. Nonlinear model
predictive control (MPC) methods provide a natural way to find a dynamically
feasible trajectory through the environment without colliding with nearby
obstacles. However, the limited computation power available on typical embedded
robotic systems, such as quadrotors, poses a challenge to running MPC in
real-time, including its most expensive tasks: constraints generation and
optimization. To address this problem, we propose a novel hierarchical MPC
scheme that consists of a planning and a tracking layer. The planner constructs
a trajectory with a long prediction horizon at a slow rate, while the tracker
ensures trajectory tracking at a relatively fast rate. We prove that the
proposed framework avoids collisions and is recursively feasible. Furthermore,
we demonstrate its effectiveness in simulations and lab experiments with a
quadrotor that needs to reach a goal position in a complex static environment.
The code is efficiently implemented on the quadrotor's embedded computer to
ensure real-time feasibility. Compared to a state-of-the-art single-layer MPC
formulation, this allows us to increase the planning horizon by a factor of 5,
which results in significantly better performance.

multi-robot motion planning and control. The main limitations of the basic
Loyd-based algorithm (LB) concern deadlock issues and the failure to address
dynamic constraints effectively. Our contribution is twofold. First, we show
how RBL is able to provide safety and convergence to the goal region without
relying on communication between robots, nor synchronization between the
robots. We considered different dynamic constraints with control inputs
saturation. Second, we show that the Lloyd-based algorithm (without rules) can
be successfully used as a safety layer for learning-based approaches, leading
to non-negligible benefits. We further prove the soundness, reliability, and
scalability of RBL through extensive simulations, comparisons with the state of
the art, and experimental validations on small-scale car-like robots,
unicycle-like robots, omnidirectional robots, and aerial robots on the field.

                                        <span>  Enforcing safety while preventing overly conservative behaviors is essential
for autonomous vehicles to achieve high task performance. In this paper, we
propose a barrier-enhanced parallel homotopic trajectory optimization (BPHTO)
approach with the over-relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) for real-time integrated decision-making and planning. To facilitate
safety interactions between the ego vehicle (EV) and surrounding vehicles, a
spatiotemporal safety module exhibiting bi-convexity is developed on the basis
of barrier function. Varying barrier coefficients are adopted for different
time steps in a planning horizon to account for the motion uncertainties of
surrounding HVs and mitigate conservative behaviors. Additionally, we exploit
the discrete characteristics of driving maneuvers to initialize nominal
behavior-oriented free-end homotopic trajectories based on reachability
analysis, and each trajectory is locally constrained to a specific driving
maneuver while sharing the same task objectives. By leveraging the bi-convexity
of the safety module and the kinematics of the EV, we formulate the BPHTO as a
bi-convex optimization problem. Then constraint transcription and the
over-relaxed ADMM are employed to streamline the optimization process, such
that multiple trajectories are generated in real time with feasibility
guarantees. Through a series of experiments, the proposed development
demonstrates improved task accuracy, stability, and consistency in various
traffic scenarios using synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.

robots. However, most reinforcement learning algorithms were not optimized for
the use of social robots, and consequently they may bore users. We proposed a
new reinforcement learning method specialized for the social robot, the
FRAC-Q-learning, that can avoid user boredom. The proposed algorithm consists
of a forgetting process in addition to randomizing and categorizing processes.
This study evaluated interest and boredom hardness scores of the
FRAC-Q-learning by a comparison with the traditional Q-learning. The
FRAC-Q-learning showed significantly higher trend of interest score, and
indicated significantly harder to bore users compared to the traditional
Q-learning. Therefore, the FRAC-Q-learning can contribute to develop a social
robot that will not bore users. The proposed algorithm has a potential to apply
for Web-based communication and educational systems. This paper presents the
entire process, detailed implementation and a detailed evaluation method of the
of the FRAC-Q-learning for the first time.

Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm framework that enables a
heterogeneous robot team to collaboratively construct object-based
metric-semantic maps of 3D environments featuring indoor, urban, and forests
without relying on GPS. The framework integrates a data-driven front-end for
instance segmentation from either RGBD cameras or LiDARs and a custom back-end
for optimizing robot trajectories and object landmarks in the map. To allow
multiple robots to merge their information, we design semantics-driven place
recognition algorithms that leverage the informativeness and viewpoint
invariance of the object-level metric-semantic map for inter-robot loop closure
detection. A communication module is designed to track each robot's
observations and those of other robots whenever communication links are
available. Our framework enables real-time decentralized operations onboard
robots, allowing them to opportunistically leverage communication. We integrate
the proposed framework with the autonomous navigation and exploration systems
of three types of aerial and ground robots, conducting extensive experiments in
a variety of indoor and outdoor environments. These experiments demonstrate
accuracy in inter-robot localization and object mapping, along with its
moderate demands on computation, storage, and communication resources. The
framework is open-sourced and available as a modular stack for object-level
metric-semantic SLAM, suitable for both single-agent and multi-robot scenarios.

of offshore wind integration, hybrid AC/DC grids are considered to be the most

to optimize the steady-state switching states of transmission lines and busbar
configurations in hybrid AC/DC grids. The proposed optimization model includes
optimal transmission switching (OTS) and busbar splitting (BS), which can be
applied to both AC and DC parts of hybrid AC/DC grids. To solve the problem, a
scalable and exact nonlinear, non-convex model using a big M approach is
formulated. In addition, convex relaxations and linear approximations of the
model are tested, and their accuracy, feasibility, and optimality are analyzed.
The numerical experiments show that a solution to the combined OTS/BS problem
can be found in acceptable computation time and that the investigated
relaxations and linearisations provide AC feasible results.

confined in small subsets of the graph. These localization phenomena are
similar to those generally termed Anderson Localization in the Physics
literature, and are related to the complexity of the structure of large graphs
in still unexplored ways. Using spectral perturbation theory and
pseudo-spectrum analysis, we explain how the presence of localized eigenvectors
gives rise to fragilities (low robustness margins) to unmodeled node or link
dynamics. Our analysis is demonstrated by examples of networks with relatively
low complexity, but with features that appear to induce eigenvector
localization. The implications of this newly-discovered fragility phenomenon
are briefly discussed.

processing steps. We model and analyze the Age of Information (AoI) performance
of various system designs under both parallel and series server setups. In
parallel setups, each processor executes all computation steps with multiple
processors working in parallel, while in series setups, each processor performs
a specific step in sequence. In practice, processing faster is better in terms
of age but it also consumes more power. We identify the occurrence of wasted
power in these setups, which arises when processing efforts do not lead to a
reduction in age. This happens when a fresher update finishes first in parallel
servers or when a server preempts processing due to a fresher update from
preceding server in series setups. To address this age-power trade-off, we
formulate and solve an optimization problem to determine the optimal service
rates for each processing step under a given power budget. We focus on a
special case where updates require two computational steps.

                                        <span>  Ensuring safety via safety filters in real-world robotics presents
significant challenges, particularly when the system dynamics is complex or
unavailable. To handle this issue, learning-based safety filters recently
gained popularity, which can be classified as model-based and model-free
methods. Existing model-based approaches requires various assumptions on system
model (e.g., control-affine), which limits their application in complex
systems, and existing model-free approaches need substantial modifications to
standard RL algorithms and lack versatility. This paper proposes a simple,
plugin-and-play, and effective model-free safety filter learning framework. We
introduce a novel reward formulation and use Q-learning to learn Q-value
functions to safeguard arbitrary task specific nominal policies via filtering
out their potentially unsafe actions. The threshold used in the filtering
process is supported by our theoretical analysis. Due to its model-free nature
and simplicity, our framework can be seamlessly integrated with various RL
algorithms. We validate the proposed approach through simulations on double
integrator and Dubin's car systems and demonstrate its effectiveness in
real-world experiments with a soft robotic limb.

under attacks with non-periodic and asynchronous sampled measurements. The
non-periodic and asynchronous sampling requires sensors to transmit not only
the measurement values but also the sampling time-stamps to the fusion center
via unprotected communication channels. This communication scheme leaves the
system vulnerable to a variety of malicious activities such as (i) manipulating
measurement values, (ii) manipulating time-stamps, (iii) hybrid manipulations
such as generating fake measurements or eliminating the measurement. To deal
with such more powerful attacks, we propose a decentralized local estimation
algorithm where each sensor maintains its local state estimate based on its
measurements in an asynchronous fashion. The local states are synchronized by
time-prediction and fused in an event-triggered manner. In the absence of
attacks, local estimates are proved to recover the optimal Kalman estimation by
our carefully designed weighted least square problem, given that the sample
time is non-pathological. In the presence of attacks, an $\ell_1$ regularized
least square problem is proposed to generate secure estimates with uniformly
bounded error as long as the observability redundancy is satisfied. The
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through a benchmark
example of the IEEE 14-bus system.

                                        <span>  Planning safe and efficient trajectories through signal-free intersections
presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in
dynamic, multi-task environments with unpredictable interactions and an
increased possibility of conflicts. This study aims to address these challenges
by developing a robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety in such complex
scenarios. Existing approaches often struggle to provide reliable safety
mechanisms in dynamic and learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in
signal-free intersections. This study proposes a safety-critical planning
method that integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF)
with a diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser
(DSC-Diffuser), offering a robust solution for adaptive, safe, and multi-task
driving in signal-free intersections. Our approach incorporates a
goal-oriented, task-guided diffusion model, enabling the model to learn
multiple driving tasks simultaneously from real-world data. To further ensure
driving safety in dynamic environments, the proposed DHOCBF framework
dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of surrounding vehicles,
offering enhanced adaptability compared to traditional control barrier
functions. Validity evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical
simulations, demonstrate its robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle
velocities, sizes, uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining
driving safety across a wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios.
Performance evaluations across various scenes confirm that DSC-Diffuser
provides realistic, stable, and generalizable policies, equipping it with the
flexibility to adapt to diverse driving tasks.

using reactive feedback control is under consideration. Based only on local
information and by considering virtual dynamics, a safe path is generated
online. The control law for the virtual dynamics is combined with a feedback
controller for the dynamics of interest, where Lyapunov arguments and forward
invariance are used to ensure that the state of the system remains in a
vicinity of the path. To allow for discrete decisions in the avoidance
controller design, the closed-loop dynamics are formulated using the hybrid
systems framework. The results are illustrated by a numerical example for
unicycle dynamics.

maintaining operational constraints and ensuring safety are essential for
efficient flow. This paper investigates the effect of intervention timing in
management strategies on maintaining operational constraints at intersections
while ensuring safe separation distance, avoiding collisions, and minimizing
delay. We introduce control regions, represented as circles around the
intersection, which refers to the timing of interventions by a centralized
control system when agents approach the intersection. We use a mixed-integer
linear programming (MILP) approach to optimize the system's performance. To
analyze the effectiveness of early and late control measures, a simulation
study is conducted, focusing on the safe, efficient, and robust management of
agent movement within the control regions.

                                        <span>  With advancements in technology, commercial aircraft formation flying is
becoming increasingly feasible as an efficient and environmentally friendly
flight method. However, gaps remain in practical implementation, particularly
in collision avoidance for aircraft formations. Existing avoidance algorithms
mainly focus on single aircraft or UAV swarms, lacking comprehensive studies on
the complex interactions within commercial aircraft formations. To address
this, this paper proposes an optimization model designed to generate safe and
effective collision avoidance solutions for commercial aircraft formations.
This model demonstrates avoidance paths for formations facing intruders and
offers insights for developing formation flight strategies. This study explores
response strategies for commercial aircraft formations encountering intruders,
considering the difficulty of pilot maneuvers. The findings provide theoretical
support for the practical implementation of commercial formation flying and may
advance the adoption of this technology.

handle unforeseen contact with environment without penetrating into soft, i.e.
viscoelastic, materials or even damaging brittle or fragile materials. Robotics
and mechatronics with tactile and haptic capabilities, and medical assistance
systems in particular, place special demands on the advanced motion control
systems that should enable safe and harmless contact transitions. This paper
demonstrates how the fundamental principles of loop shaping can easily be used
to handle the sufficiently stiff motion control with a sensor-free dynamic
extension to reconfigure at contact with environment. Hybrid control scheme is
proposed. Remarkable feature of the developed approach is that no measurement
of the contact force is required and the input signal and measured output
displacement are the only quantities used for control design and operation.
Experimental scenarios for 1DOF actuator are shown where the moving tool comes
into contact with grape fruits that are soft and penetrable at the same time.

Control algorithm, which uses an ensemble of learned models for prediction,
with a runtime monitor to flag unreliable out-of-distribution (OOD)
predictions. When an OOD situation is detected, SODA-MPC triggers a safe
fallback control strategy based on reachability, yielding a control framework
that achieves the high performance of learning-based models while preserving
the safety of reachability-based control. We demonstrate the method in the
context of an autonomous vehicle, driving among dynamic pedestrians, where
SODA-MPC uses a neural network ensemble for pedestrian prediction. We calibrate
the OOD signal using conformal prediction to derive an OOD detector with
probabilistic guarantees on the false-positive rate, given a user-specified
confidence level. During in-distribution operation, the MPC controller avoids
collisions with a pedestrian based on the trajectory predicted by the mean of
the ensemble. When OOD conditions are detected, the MPC switches to a
reachability-based controller to avoid collisions with the reachable set of the
pedestrian assuming a maximum pedestrian speed, to guarantee safety under the
worst-case actions of the pedestrian. We verify SODA-MPC in extensive
autonomous driving simulations in a pedestrian-crossing scenario. Our model
ensemble is trained and calibrated with real pedestrian data, showing that our
OOD detector obtains the desired accuracy rate within a theoretically-predicted
range. We empirically show improved safety and improved task completion
compared with two state-of-the-art MPC methods that also use conformal
prediction, but without OOD adaptation. Further, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method with the large-scale multi-agent predictor
Trajectron++, using large-scale traffic data from the nuScenes dataset for
training and calibration.

inductors with distributed gaps for high-power and compact DC-DC Converters.
The focus is eddy current loss components within the conductors due to fringing
and leakage fluxes. A magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) is proposed in which
eddy currents are modeled by MMFs opposing the primary flux as well as
frequency dependent reluctances, which finally leads to a frequency dependent
inductance describing the behavior of the inductor at high frequencies. Three
formulations for DC resistance depending on the required accuracy are
developed. Calculations of the AC resistance based on vector potential obtained
from FEM are provided. To provide an insight into the optimized design of such
inductors, components of the magnetic flux and induced eddy currents along with
sensitivity of the main inductor quantities such as DCR, ESR, loss components
and inductance values to the design parameters are investigated. Finally, an
inductor is prototyped and experimentally tested to verify the design.

                                        <span>  Hybrid dynamical systems are ubiquitous as practical robotic applications
often involve both continuous states and discrete switchings. Safety is a
primary concern for hybrid robotic systems. Existing safety-critical control
approaches for hybrid systems are either computationally inefficient,
detrimental to system performance, or limited to small-scale systems. To amend
these drawbacks, in this paper, we propose a learning-enabled approach to
construct local Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee the safety of a
wide class of nonlinear hybrid dynamical systems. The end result is a safe
neural CBF-based switching controller. Our approach is computationally
efficient, minimally invasive to any reference controller, and applicable to
large-scale systems. We empirically evaluate our framework and demonstrate its
efficacy and flexibility through two robotic examples including a
high-dimensional autonomous racing case, against other CBF-based approaches and
model predictive control.

                                        <span>  While reinforcement learning has shown experimental success in a number of
applications, it is known to be sensitive to noise and perturbations in the
parameters of the system, leading to high variance in the total reward amongst
different episodes in slightly different environments. To introduce robustness,
as well as sample efficiency, risk-sensitive reinforcement learning methods are
being thoroughly studied. In this work, we provide a definition of robust
reinforcement learning policies and formulate a risk-sensitive reinforcement
learning problem to approximate them, by solving an optimization problem with
respect to a modified objective based on exponential criteria. In particular,
we study a model-free risk-sensitive variation of the widely-used Monte Carlo
Policy Gradient algorithm and introduce a novel risk-sensitive online
Actor-Critic algorithm based on solving a multiplicative Bellman equation using
stochastic approximation updates. Analytical results suggest that the use of
exponential criteria generalizes commonly used ad-hoc regularization
approaches, improves sample efficiency, and introduces robustness with respect
to perturbations in the model parameters and the environment. The
implementation, performance, and robustness properties of the proposed methods
are evaluated in simulated experiments.

learning robust power system state representations, which strives to optimize
power dispatch for the power flow adjustment across different transmission
sections. Specifically, our proposed approach, named Powerformer, develops a
dedicated section-adaptive attention mechanism, separating itself from the
self-attention used in conventional transformers. This mechanism effectively
integrates power system states with transmission section information, which
facilitates the development of robust state representations. Furthermore, by
considering the graph topology of power system and the electrical attributes of
bus nodes, we introduce two customized strategies to further enhance the
expressiveness: graph neural network propagation and multi-factor attention
mechanism. Extensive evaluations are conducted on three power system scenarios,
including the IEEE 118-bus system, a realistic 300-bus system in China, and a
large-scale European system with 9241 buses, where Powerformer demonstrates its
superior performance over several baseline methods.

                                        <span>  The European Union's climate targets challenge the building sector to reduce
energy use while ensuring comfort. Ventilation systems play an important role
in achieving these goals. During system planning, the primary focus tends to
lie on reducing life-cycle costs, including energy and investment expenses.
Acoustic considerations which contribute significantly to occupant comfort, are
either addressed as an afterthought or overlooked. This can result in
suboptimal designs, where silencers are added indiscriminately without properly
assessing their necessity. This paper introduces a novel method for optimising
life-cycle costs through mathematical optimisation while adhering to predefined
noise limits. We propose new model equations with reduce non-linearity better
suited for integration into the optimisation framework. Further, they present a
comprehensive approach to optimising ventilation systems under multiple load
scenarios. Our method surpasses the traditional sequential approach by enabling
simultaneous consideration of airflow and acoustics in a single, holistic
optimisation step. A case study demonstrates the method's practical
application, showing that optimal solutions can be computed efficiently. The
results reveal that, with appropriate fan selection, many silencers can be
eliminated. Additionally, the method supports decision-making by transparently
illustrating the trade-offs between life-cycle costs and noise limits. Notably,
while optimal solutions from the sequential and holistic approaches align for
most noise limits, the holistic method achieves a 12 % reduction in costs under
specific noise constraints. These results demonstrate the benefits of
integrating airflow and acoustic design while underscoring the need for further
application on more diverse building types and more complex ventilation system
configurations.

                                        <span>  As an effective emulator of ill-conditioned power flow, continuous Newton
methods (CNMs) have been extensively investigated using explicit and implicit
numerical integration algorithms. Explicit CNMs are prone to non-convergence
issues due to their limited stable region, while implicit CNMs introduce
additional iteration-loops of nonlinear equations. Faced with this, we propose
a semi-implicit version of CNM. We formulate the power flow equations as a set
of differential algebraic equations (DAEs), and solve the DAEs with the stiffly
accurate Rosenbrock type method (SARM). The proposed method succeeds the
numerical robustness from the implicit CNM framework while prevents the
iterative solution of nonlinear systems, hence revealing higher convergence
speed and computation efficiency. A new 4-stage 3rd-order hyper-stable SARM,
together with a 2nd-order embedded formula to control the step size, is
constructed to further accelerate convergence by tuning the damping factor.
Case studies on ill-conditioned systems verified the alleged performance. An
algorithm extension for MATPOWER is made available on Github for benchmarking.

multi-modal transportation systems has become increasingly important to reduce
traffic congestion and improve user mobility. Most RH studies used nominal
scenarios with regular demand patterns. However, disruptions must be considered
due to their negative impact on operational efficiency, such as longer travel
times, higher costs, increased transfers, and more service delays. Therefore,
this study investigates the resilience of RH fleet management strategies in
multi-modal transportation systems against disruptions on train lines. Two
fleet management strategies, centralized and decentralized, are introduced to
evaluate their performance. A traffic simulation is conducted using a 900 km2
toy urban network that includes multiple transportation modes such as trains,
metros, buses, and RHs. The results revealed that during the peak of
disruption, the centralized strategy maintained a higher level of service but
required a longer recovery time. In contrast, the decentralized strategy showed
a lower service level but recovered more quickly. The centralized strategy
showed higher performance during regular scenarios, while the decentralized
strategy showed better resilience during disruptions. Comparing the two
strategies provides critical insights for developing intermediate RH strategies
to effectively manage disruptions and enhance the seamlessness of multi-modal
transportation systems.

capacitated network design problem to enable cargo-hitching in existing PTSs.
Specifically, we study a setting with fixed vehicle routes and timetables in
which vehicles can be equipped with HTUs to enable cargo-hitching. We optimize
the network design from a total cost perspective to account for normalized
network design costs tied to the investment in HTUs and freight routing costs.
We present an algorithmic framework that encodes some of the problem's
constraints in a spatially and temporally expanded, layered graph, and solves
the resulting network design problem with a price-and-branch algorithm. We
apply this framework to a case study based on the subway network in the city of
Munich. Our algorithm outscales commercial solvers by a factor of six and
yields integer feasible solutions with a median integrality gap of less than
1.02% for all instances. We show that cargo-hitching with HTUs increases the
utilization of PTSs, especially during off-peak hours, without cannibalizing
passenger service level and quality. Moreover, we present a sensitivity
analysis that indicates that cargo-hitching is worthwhile if truck-based
transport occurs at an externality cost of more than EUR 1.6 per vehicle and
kilometer and loading and unloading costs of less than EUR 2 per passenger
equivalent.

also examine distributional solutions of the adjoint system, showing their

can be reformulated as a null controllability problem for a cascade quasilinear
system with dynamic boundary conditions. To this end, we approach the problem
by first dealing with null controllability in the framework of an inhomogeneous
linearized system. Next, we derive new estimates of control and state, allowing
us to apply a local inversion theorem to obtain null controllability of the
quasilinear system.

possible sites and allocating a set of clients to them in such a way that the
maximum distance between a client and the facility to which it is allocated is
minimized. This paper proposes a new scalable exact solution algorithm based on
client clustering and an iterative distance rounding procedure. The client
clustering enables to initialize and update a subset of clients for which the
p-center problem is iteratively solved. The rounding drastically reduces the
number of distinct distances considered at each iteration. Our algorithm is
tested on 396 benchmark instances with up to 1.9 million clients and
facilities. We outperform the two state-of-the-art exact methods considered
when p is not very small (i.e., p > 5).

coefficient is proportional to the square root of the Tikhonov regularization
parameter. Under an appropriate setting of the parameters, we prove the strong
convergence of the trajectory of the proposed system towards the minimum norm

further establish some convergence rate results of the trajectories. Finally,
the validity of the proposed dynamical system is demonstrated by a numerical

decentralised finance (DeFi) by formulating it as an ergodic optimal control
problem. In decentralised derivatives exchanges, liquidation is triggered
whenever the parties fail to maintain sufficient collateral for their open
positions. Consequently, effectively managing and liquidating disposal of
positions accrued through liquidations is a critical concern for decentralised
derivatives exchanges. By simplifying the model (linear temporary and permanent
price impacts, simplified cash balance dynamics), we derive the closed-form
solutions for the optimal liquidation strategies, which balance immediate
executions with the temporary and permanent price impacts, and the optimal
long-term average reward. Numerical simulations further highlight the
effectiveness of the proposed optimal strategy and demonstrate that the
simplified model closely approximates the original market environment. Finally,
we provide the method for calibrating the parameters in the model from the
available data.

                                        <span>  Safe obstacle avoidance and target set stabilization for nonlinear systems
using reactive feedback control is under consideration. Based only on local
information and by considering virtual dynamics, a safe path is generated
online. The control law for the virtual dynamics is combined with a feedback
controller for the dynamics of interest, where Lyapunov arguments and forward
invariance are used to ensure that the state of the system remains in a
vicinity of the path. To allow for discrete decisions in the avoidance
controller design, the closed-loop dynamics are formulated using the hybrid
systems framework. The results are illustrated by a numerical example for
unicycle dynamics.

                                        <span>  Distributed non-convex optimization over multi-agent networks is a growing
area of interest. In this paper, we propose a decentralized algorithm called
Two Time Scale EXTRA (TT-EXTRA), which can be considered as a modified version
of the well-known EXTRA algorithm. EXTRA is very general and is closely related
to gradient tracking-based algorithms, such as DIGGING, as well as the
Primal-Dual Gradient algorithm in distributed settings. It has been established
that EXTRA achieves sublinear convergence to an exact minimizer in the convex
case and linear convergence in the strongly convex case. However, a convergence
analysis of EXTRA for non-convex scenarios remains absent in the current
literature. We address this gap by proving that TT-EXTRA converges to a set of
consensual first-order stationary points for non-convex distributed
optimization problems.

                                        <span>  This research presents a Python-based simulation framework designed to model
electric vehicle (EV) on-demand transportation systems, with a focus on
optimizing urban fleet operations. Built on a process-driven architecture, the
system efficiently simulates EV fleet dynamics, including passenger matching,
vehicle dispatching, and charging strategies, while enabling customization to
address critical challenges such as charger placement, fleet management, and
algorithm performance. We overcome the challenge of high dimensional
state-space and non-Markovian system dynamics by executing processes
asynchronously using SimPy and updating only the states that are affected by
employing object-oriented programming. As a result, our simulation framework is
capable of handling peak demand scenarios involving thousands of trips and
completing multi-day scenarios in minutes. The modular design enables users to
experiment with parameters, test algorithms, and integrate custom datasets,
making the tool highly adaptable for diverse urban contexts. By providing a
realistic and extensible platform, this adaptable, scalable, and open-source
framework advances the optimization of EV fleet operations and offers a
valuable resource for decision-makers and city planners navigating the
transition to sustainable urban mobility solutions.
  We also present a case study using the NYC taxi dataset evaluating various
dispatching algorithms, including closest vehicle dispatch, closest available
vehicle dispatch, and power-of-d vehicle dispatch, and exploring charging
approaches like continuous and nighttime charging. We propose a novel adaptive
power-of-d dispatch policy, which dynamically adjusts to real-time conditions
and demonstrates high throughputs when combined with adaptive charging policies
that interrupt charging to meet demand during the peak and delay some of the
charging to the nighttime.

survival and reproductive success. We propose an optimal switching model to
study bird migration, where birds' migration behaviors are modeled as switching
between different stochastic diffusion processes. For individual with perfect
information, we formulate the Hamilton-Jacobi Bellman equations which are then
solved numerically to obtain the expected payoff and corresponding optimal
control. For individuals with partial information, we complement the dynamic
programming method with stochastic simulations to study the optimal strategies
and the effect of information in such a setting. Finally, we apply the model to
address several specific biological questions by characterizing the optimal
strategies of birds under different scenarios.

the development of essential lemmas that provide a rigorous foundation for

                                        <span>  Inverse problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Many of these are
naturally formulated as a PDE-constrained optimization problem. These
non-linear, large-scale, constrained optimization problems know many
challenges, of which the inherent non-linearity of the problem is an important
one. In this paper, we focus on a relaxed formulation of the PDE-constrained
optimization problem and provide an in-depth analysis of it. Starting from an
infinite-dimensional formulation of the inverse problem with discrete data, we
propose a general framework for the analysis and discretisation of such
problems. The relaxed formulation of the PDE-constrained optimization problem
is shown to reduce to a weighted non-linear least-squares problem. The weight
matrix turns out to be the Gram matrix of solutions of the PDE and, in some
cases, can be estimated directly from the measurements. The latter observation
points to a potential way to unify recently proposed data-driven reduced-order
models for inverse problems with PDE-constrained optimization. We provide a
number of representative case studies and numerical examples to illustrate our
findings.

                                        <span>  This paper introduces Weighted Optimal Classification Forests (WOCFs), a new
family of classifiers that takes advantage of an optimal ensemble of decision
trees to derive accurate and interpretable classifiers. We propose a novel
mathematical optimization-based methodology which simultaneously constructs a
given number of trees, each of them providing a predicted class for the
observations in the feature space. The classification rule is derived by
assigning to each observation its most frequently predicted class among the
trees. We provide a mixed integer linear programming formulation (MIP) for the
problem and several novel MIP strengthening / scaling techniques. We report the
results of our computational experiments, from which we conclude that our
method has equal or superior performance compared with state-of-the-art
tree-based classification methods for small to medium-sized instances. We also
present three real-world case studies showing that our methodology has very
interesting implications in terms of interpretability. Overall, WOCFs
complement existing methods such as CART, Optimal Classification Trees, Random
Forests and XGBoost. In addition to its Pareto improvement on accuracy and
interpretability, we also see unique properties emerging in terms of different
trees focusing on different feature variables. This provides nontrivial
improvement in interpretability and usability of the trained model in terms of
counterfactual explanation. Thus, despite the apparent computational challenge
of WOCFs that limit the size of the problems that can be efficiently solved
with current MIP, this is an important research direction that can lead to
qualitatively different insights for researchers and complement the toolbox of
practitioners for high stakes problems.

                                        <span>  Adaptive gradient methods have been increasingly adopted by deep learning
community due to their fast convergence and reduced sensitivity to
hyper-parameters. However, these methods come with limitations, such as
increased memory requirements for elements like moving averages and a poorly
understood convergence theory. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
F-CMA, a Fast-Controlled Mini-batch Algorithm with a random reshuffling method
featuring a sufficient decrease condition and a line-search procedure to ensure
loss reduction per epoch, along with its deterministic proof of global
convergence to a stationary point. To evaluate the F-CMA, we integrate it into
conventional training protocols for classification tasks involving both
convolutional neural networks and vision transformer models, allowing for a
direct comparison with popular optimizers. Computational tests show significant
improvements, including a decrease in the overall training time by up to 68%,
an increase in per-epoch efficiency by up to 20%, and in model accuracy by up
to 5%.

                                        <span>  In deep learning, different kinds of deep networks typically need different
optimizers, which have to be chosen after multiple trials, making the training
process inefficient. To relieve this issue and consistently improve the model
training speed across deep networks, we propose the ADAptive Nesterov momentum
algorithm, Adan for short. Adan first reformulates the vanilla Nesterov
acceleration to develop a new Nesterov momentum estimation (NME) method, which
avoids the extra overhead of computing gradient at the extrapolation point.
Then, Adan adopts NME to estimate the gradient's first- and second-order
moments in adaptive gradient algorithms for convergence acceleration. Besides,
we prove that Adan finds an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point
within $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3.5})$ stochastic gradient complexity on the
non-convex stochastic problems (e.g., deep learning problems), matching the
best-known lower bound. Extensive experimental results show that Adan
consistently surpasses the corresponding SoTA optimizers on vision, language,
and RL tasks and sets new SoTAs for many popular networks and frameworks, e.g.,
ResNet, ConvNext, ViT, Swin, MAE, DETR, GPT-2, Transformer-XL, and BERT. More
surprisingly, Adan can use half of the training cost (epochs) of SoTA
optimizers to achieve higher or comparable performance on ViT, GPT-2, MAE,
etc., and also shows great tolerance to a large range of minibatch size, e.g.,
from 1k to 32k. Code is released at https://github.com/sail-sg/Adan, and has
been used in multiple popular deep learning frameworks or projects.

                                        <span>  To efficiently train large-scale models, low-bit gradient communication
compresses full-precision gradients on local GPU nodes into low-precision ones
for higher gradient synchronization efficiency among GPU nodes. However, it
often degrades training quality due to compression information loss. To address
this, we propose the Low-bit Communication Adaptor (LoCo), which compensates
gradients on local GPU nodes before compression, ensuring efficient
synchronization without compromising training quality. Specifically, LoCo
designs a moving average of historical compensation errors to stably estimate
concurrent compression error and then adopts it to compensate for the
concurrent gradient compression, yielding a less lossless compression. This
mechanism allows it to be compatible with general optimizers like Adam and
sharding strategies like FSDP. Theoretical analysis shows that integrating LoCo
into full-precision optimizers like Adam and SGD does not impair their
convergence speed on nonconvex problems. Experimental results show that across
large-scale model training frameworks like Megatron-LM and PyTorch's FSDP, LoCo
significantly improves communication efficiency, e.g., improving Adam's
training speed by 14% to 40% without performance degradation on large language
models like LLAMAs and MoE.

differentiable with locally Lipschitz gradients. We prove that global
convergence holds if continuous gradient trajectories are bounded, with the
minimum gradient norm vanishing at the rate $o(1/k)$ if the step sizes are
greater than a positive constant. If additionally the gradient is continuously
differentiable, all saddle points are strict, and the step sizes are constant,
then convergence to a local minimum holds almost surely over any bounded set of
initial points.

                                        <span>  Block majorization-minimization (BMM) is a simple iterative algorithm for
constrained nonconvex optimization that sequentially minimizes majorizing
surrogates of the objective function in each block while the others are held
fixed. BMM entails a large class of optimization algorithms such as block
coordinate descent and its proximal-point variant, expectation-minimization,
and block projected gradient descent. We first establish that for general
constrained nonsmooth nonconvex optimization, BMM with $\rho$-strongly convex
and $L_g$-smooth surrogates can produce an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order
optimal point within $\widetilde{O}((1+L_g+\rho^{-1})\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations
and asymptotically converges to the set of first-order optimal points. Next, we
show that BMM combined with trust-region methods with diminishing radius has an
improved complexity of $\widetilde{O}((1+L_g) \epsilon^{-2})$, independent of
the inverse strong convexity parameter $\rho^{-1}$, allowing improved
theoretical and practical performance with `flat' surrogates. Our results hold
robustly even when the convex sub-problems are solved as long as the optimality
gaps are summable. Central to our analysis is a novel continuous first-order
optimality measure, by which we bound the worst-case sub-optimality in each
iteration by the first-order improvement the algorithm makes. We apply our
general framework to obtain new results on various algorithms such as the
celebrated multiplicative update algorithm for nonnegative matrix factorization
by Lee and Seung, regularized nonnegative tensor decomposition, and the
classical block projected gradient descent algorithm. Lastly, we numerically
demonstrate that the additional use of diminishing radius can improve the
convergence rate of BMM in many instances.
